<p>It would be interesting, on accompanying Johannes Brahms
in imagination on his first visit to Vienna&mdash;a visit that was to
lead to results scarcely less important to his career than those
of the first concert-journey through the provincial towns
of Hanover undertaken nine years and a half previously&mdash;to
describe the gradual change which had taken place in the
musical life of the imperial city since the times when it had
counted Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven in turn among its
inhabitants. It would, however, lead too far from the
purpose of this narrative to follow the course by which the
art of music, from being a luxury to be enjoyed chiefly by
the rich&mdash;and in Vienna, perhaps, especially amongst the
great capitals of Europe&mdash;had been opened to the cultivation
of the masses of citizens. Suffice it to say that in the autumn
of 1862 the conditions of musical activity in the Austrian
capital were essentially the same as we know them in 1905.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>The Court Opera, the home of which was the K&auml;rthnerthor
Theater, was conducted by Otto Dessoff, who had been
a distinguished pupil of the Leipzig Conservatoire, and had
succeeded the celebrated capellmeister, Carl Anton Eckert,
on his resignation of the post in 1860. In intimate though
not official connection with the opera were the Philharmonic
concerts given in the same building. These, started in 1849
by the orchestral musicians of the opera as their own undertaking,
had, after a period of varying fortune, entered upon
a flourishing phase of existence. They were conducted by
Dessoff in virtue of his position as capellmeister of the opera,
and though his rather cold style at first prevented his
winning Austrian sympathy, he by-and-by succeeded in
making good his footing by his musicianship and thoroughness,
and by the perfect finish of rendering that was attained
by the orchestra under his direction.</p>

<p>The annual orchestral concerts given by the great
Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Society of Music-lovers),
founded in 1813, took place in the Redoubtensaal, and,
though given under the Society's own 'artistic director,'
had, during the eight or nine years preceding the appointment
of Johann Herbeck to this post (1859), been dependent
on the services of the opera orchestra. Herbeck, feeling
the inconveniences of such an arrangement, determined to
form an orchestra of his own, and, whilst successfully
carrying out his project, sought to make amends for the first
inevitable lack of complete finish in his performances by
cultivating a liberal spirit in the choice of programmes, and
introducing from time to time unfamiliar works by the best
modern classical composers. From this period the Gesellschaft
and the Philharmonic concerts came more or less to
represent severally the liberal and the conservative spirit
of classical art, though it must be added that Dessoff
cherished the wish to educate his audience to wider powers
of appreciation, and sometimes included the name of
Schumann in the Philharmonic programmes, which, before
his advent, had been closed to works of more modern tendency
than those of Mendelssohn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Parallel with these two institutions for the performance of
instrumental music were two choral societies, both supplied
by amateurs. The Singverein, a branch of the Gesellschaft
der Musikfreunde, which in 1862 was, like the orchestra,
under Herbeck's direction, occupied itself with every kind
of classical choral music in turn, and, occasionally giving
concerts independently, often joined forces in public performance
with the orchestra. The Singakademie, founded
in 1858 by a circle of amateurs, made a special point of early
church music, and of <i>a capella</i> singing, but usually devoted
one of its three or four annual concerts to the performance
of an oratorio or other great work, when, of course, the
services of an orchestra were engaged. Under the direction
of its first conductor, F. Stegmayer, the Singakademie gave
the first performance in Vienna of portions of Schumann's
'Faust' (January 6, 1861) and of Bach's 'Matthew Passion'
(April 15, 1862).</p>

<p>Occupying a position in Vienna at the very top of his profession,
partly in virtue of the musical prestige attaching to
his family name, but mainly as the result of his personal
gifts and attainments, was the violinist Josef Hellmesberger,
director and professor of the conservatoire (itself another
branch of the great Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde), concertmeister
of the opera, and therefore also of the Philharmonic
concerts, late artistic director of the Gesellschaft (1851-1859),
leader of the only resident and justly celebrated string
quartet party called by his name, and accomplished virtuoso.
Hellmesberger's playing lacked broadness of tone, but was
distinguished by grace, poetic sentiment, and a facile instinct
for his composer's intention. He possessed a good knowledge
of the orchestra, and was a fair pianist.</p>

<p>Of other musicians resident in the Austrian capital in 1862
are to be mentioned the great contrapuntist Sechter, nearly
approaching the end of his career, who, in his position of
professor of composition at the conservatoire, had in his time
taught several of the younger men next to be referred to;
Nottebohm, professor of counterpoint at the conservatoire,
known to the world by his writings on music, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
those on Beethoven's sketch-books; Rudolph Bibl, organist
of the cathedral, and later, of the imperial chapel; Julius
Epstein, professor of the pianoforte at the conservatoire,
distinguished pianist and widely-reputed teacher, and
esteemed, not only on account of his professional standing,
but also by reason of his kindness to all persons having any
sort of claim on his courtesy.</p>

<p>The composer Carl Goldmark, who has since attained
European reputation with his opera 'The Queen of Sheba,'
had been almost entirely resident in Vienna since his sixteenth
year, and now at thirty was rising to fame. Peter
Cornelius, composer of the comic opera 'The Barber of
Bagdad,' and already mentioned in our narrative as a disciple
of Weimar, was living at this time in the Austrian
capital. Anton Br&uuml;ckner was favourably esteemed by some
of the first resident musicians, though he had not yet been
called there. Carl Tausig, one of the greatest of pianoforte
virtuosi, whose sympathies were much with the New-Germans,
settled in Vienna for a few years from 1861, and
gave occasional concerts there which were but partially
successful.</p>

<p>Of writers and critics, Edward Hanslick, Carl Ferdinand
Pohl, and Selmar Bagge, all believers in the art of tradition
and in its modern development as represented by the name
of Schumann, were in the flower of their activity. Bagge's
name is interesting in the history of Brahms' career on
account of the sympathetic and detailed reviews of the
composer's works which appeared from time to time in the
<i>Deutsche Musikzeitung</i>, a paper founded by him in 1860.
It became defunct at the close of 1863, when Bagge left
Vienna to take up the editorship of the <i>Allgemeine Musikzeitung</i>,
which he retained for two years. Very able articles
were published in this periodical of Brahms' works as they
appeared, some of them written by Bagge himself, and others
by Hermann Deiters, a musical scholar and critic of exceptional
insight and power of happy expression. Bagge
remained just long enough in Vienna to witness the interest
aroused by Brahms' first appearances there, to which, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
likely, the remembrance of the articles of the <i>Deutsche Musikzeitung</i>
gave additional stimulus.</p>

<p>Of publishers, the name of C. A. Spina should be gratefully
remembered as that of the man to whom the world is indebted
for the publication of many great and long-neglected
works of Schubert. A large number of the master's half-forgotten
manuscripts&mdash;those of the Octet, the C major
Quartet, the B flat and B minor Symphonies amongst them&mdash;were
found by Spina when he took over the business of his
predecessors, the firm of Diabelli, and were gradually placed
by him in the possession of the world.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Vienna, Brahms put up at the H&ocirc;tel
Kronprinz in the Leopoldstadt, moving soon afterwards
into a room at 39, Novaragasse, of the same inexpensive
quarter, then called the J&auml;gerzeil. Several of his old friends
were fortunately at hand. Gr&auml;dener had given up his
position in Hamburg the preceding year to try his fortune
in Vienna; Frau Passy-Cornet, whose name calls the concert
of 1848 to remembrance, was now a professor of singing at
the Vienna Conservatoire; and, a very few weeks after
Brahms' arrival, Arthur Faber, lately married to Fr&auml;ulein
Bertha Porubszky, brought his bride to their home in the
imperial city. His house was, of course, open to Johannes,
who spent many, and especially Sunday, evenings with
these friends. Amongst the most treasured memories of
their early wedded life are those of performances of his
compositions, played as he could play when quietly at ease
with a few sympathetic friends for all audience.</p>

<p>From the first he felt at home in Vienna. The good-natured,
easy-going Austrian people attracted him, and he at
once conceived an affection for the Prater, in the immediate
vicinity of which his hotel was situated. This great park of
the Kaiserstadt contains, indeed, attractions to suit every
variety of taste. There is the Hauptall&eacute;e, with its broad
drive and shady walks, its open-air caf&eacute;s and music of military
bands, which play waltzes and various dance movements
as they are played in no other city. There is the W&uuml;rstelprater,
the playground of children and other simple folk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
where, in the fine-weather season, a continual fair goes on
with shows and games and entertainments of every kind
likely to attract the patronage of the multitude, and where
in the Hungarian restaurant, the 'Czarda,' real gipsy music
played by a real gipsy band may daily be heard. There is
the wild portion, bounded on one side by the Danube canal
and stretching for some little distance beyond the town,
where the solitary walker may fancy himself in a forest far
from human habitation. Brahms, on this occasion of his
first visit to Vienna, particularly attached himself to the
W&uuml;rstelprater, for which he ever after retained his partiality.
The motley life to be seen there amused and interested him.
He came to be a frequent listener at the 'Czarda,' and it is
whispered that the spirit of fun has occasionally prompted
him, when at the height of his fame, to prevail upon a party
of friends to take a turn in his company on the curvetting
horses of one or other of the 'carrousels' which are amongst
the most popular attractions of this part of the grounds.</p>

<p>One of Brahms' first visits was to Julius Epstein. He
did not send in his name, and, as the professor was engaged
with someone else at the moment, was not admitted. A
second call was successful. 'My name is Johannes Brahms,'
he said as he entered; and his simple manner at once
attracted Epstein, who was well acquainted with his
published works. An opportunity was arranged without
delay for his introduction to some of the leading musicians
of the city.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms in 1862 played the Quartets in G minor and
A major with the members of the Hellmesberger Quartet
(Hellmesberger, Dobyhal and R&ouml;ver) at my house in the
Schulerstrasse, in the first place,' writes Professor Epstein
to the author. 'We were all delighted and carried away.
The works were shortly afterwards played in public by
Brahms with the same colleagues.'</p>

<p>The G minor Quartet was, in fact, included in the list of
works announced by Hellmesberger for the ensuing season,
and the immediate interest awakened in musical circles by
the arrival of the composer is even more strikingly testified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
by the fact that on October 14, only five weeks after his
departure from Hamburg, the name of the orchestral
Serenade in D major appeared in the forecast of the Gesellschaft
season published in the <i>Bl&auml;tter f&uuml;r Theater, K&uuml;nst und
Musik</i>.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening, November 16, Brahms made his first
appearance before his new public at Hellmesberger's Quartet
concert, which took place, as usual, in the Vereinsaal (the
concert-room of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde) before an
audience that crowded every part of the house in anticipation
of the d&eacute;but in Vienna of 'Schumann's young prophet.' The
first and last numbers of the programme of three works
were severally Mendelssohn's String Quartet in E flat and
Beethoven's in C sharp minor, Op. 131, Brahms' G minor
Pianoforte Quartet occupying the place of honour between
them. If we were to judge of the result by the press reviews
of the day, which were either unfavourable or reserved, it
would be impossible to chronicle a success, and yet that the
work was essentially successful is established by the fact that
the composer received overtures after the concert from more
than one Vienna publisher, which, however, he declined.
He had certainly made his mark in his own characteristic
way even before the 16th. A private circle of admirers
began to form round him, and he was sufficiently encouraged
to venture on a concert of his own, which took place in the
Vereinsaal on November 29.</p>

<p>On this occasion the Pianoforte Quartet in A major
headed the programme, the composer being assisted in its
performance by the three members of the Hellmesberger
party with whom he had already appeared. The remaining
instrumental numbers were pianoforte solos, the concert-giver's
Handel Variations and Fugue, Bach's F major
Toccata for organ, and Schumann's C major Fantasia,
Op. 17.</p>

<p>As regards the general audience, the concert was an
unmistakable success. The room was fairly filled, and
enough money taken to cover expenses. This, however, by
the way. The circumstance most worthy of record is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
artist and public found themselves <i>en rapport</i>. The performer
had the infallible instinct of having with him the
sympathy of his hearers, and played his best, giving out
what was really in him as he had probably never been able
to do before his indifferent or sceptical audiences in Germany.
A friendly reception was accorded to the quartet, which was
followed with close attention. Enthusiasm could scarcely
have been looked for on a first hearing of so original a work.
The variations and fugue, however, called forth a storm of
applause that was renewed after the performance of
Schumann's fantasia, the divine last movement of which was
given with ideal insight and noble inspiration. The press
notices, though respectful, were disappointing in regard to
Brahms the composer.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The quartet by no means pleased us, and we are glad that
the unfavourable impression it created was obliterated by the
variations which followed....' Hanslick wrote (<i>die Presse</i>).
'Brahms' talent has hitherto been displayed at its best
in variation form, which requires, above all, facility in
inventing figures, and unity of mood.... The unsatisfactory
features of his creative style are more apparent in the
quartet. The first subject has not enough significance. The
composer chooses themes rather with a view to their capacity
for contrapuntal treatment than on account of their intrinsic
merit, and those of the quartet sound dry and flat.... The
quartet and others of the composer's works remind us of
Schumann's last period; the early works of his first period;
but none of Brahms' yet known compositions can take their
place beside those of Schumann's ripe middle period.'</p>

<p>As a pianist, Brahms was mentioned in the papers in more
decided terms of appreciation. Bagge says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'We have to bestow high praise not only on the enormous
technical acquirement, but also on a performance instinct
with musical genius, on a treatment of the instrument as
fascinating as it was original.'</p>

<p>The playing of Bach's organ toccata is especially mentioned
in terms of high admiration; the touch employed
for the passages written for the pedals 'gave the pianoforte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the effect of an organ.' The performance of each number was
musical through and through, and although 'he has not the
unfailing certainty nor the outward brilliancy of the virtuoso,
he reaches and fascinates his audience by other means.'</p>

<p>The delightful natural letter to his parents, published by
Reimann, written after the concert, shows the pleasure derived
by Brahms from feeling his audience in sympathy with him:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Parents</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I was very happy yesterday, my concert went quite
excellently, much better than I had hoped.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'After the quartet had been sympathetically received, I
had great success as a player. Every number was greatly
applauded, I think there was real enthusiasm in the room.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Now I could very well give concerts, but I do not wish
to do so, for it takes up too much time so that I can do
nothing else....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I played as freely as though I were sitting at home with
friends; one is certainly influenced quite differently by the
public than by ours.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'You should have seen the attention and seen and heard
the applause.... I am very glad I gave the concert.
You are probably rid of your guests again now and will
be able to find a moment of time to write to me?</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Tell the contents of this letter to Herr Marxsen and
say also that B&ouml;rsendorfer<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> will not be able to send a piano
before the New Year as so many are required for concerts.
Shall I see about another for him? I await orders....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I think my serenade will be given next Monday.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I should have liked to introduce some of my vocal things
in my concert yesterday, but it gave me a terrible amount
of running about and unpleasantness and that is one of my
reasons for wishing to be quiet now.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="blockquot">'Did you sit together on Wednesday over the egg-punch?

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'The publishers here, especially Spina and Levi, have
been pressing me for things since the quartet, but much
pleases me better in North Germany and particularly the
publishers, and I would rather go without the two or three
extra Louis-d'ors that these would perhaps pay.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Does Av&eacute; often go to see you? Has he told you anything
particular about Stockhausen?</p>

<p class="blockquot">'How about the photograph of the girls' quartet? Am I
not to have it? N.B. Every time I write I forget to ask
about Fritz.... Is he very industrious? He ought to
make up his mind to give Trio concerts in Hamburg next
winter. I would help him in every way....</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right:10em">'Write soon and have love</p>
<p class="right" style="padding-right:10em">'from your</p>

<p>The two Pianoforte Quartets were despatched to Simrock,
and were published by the firm early in 1863&mdash;the first one
in G minor, being dedicated to Baron Reinhard von Dalwigk,
Court Intendant to the Grand-Duke of Oldenburg, a really
musical amateur and a warm supporter of Brahms; and the
second, in A major, to Frau Dr. Elisabeth R&ouml;sing of Hamm,
in whose house it was written.</p>

<p>The tone of the above extracts tells how lovingly the
composer's thoughts turned to his home at the moment he
was feeling conscious of a real success; and the question
about Stockhausen may be taken as an indication of the
clinging wistfulness with which he was bringing himself to
resign the hope of being able to settle near his family as
conductor of the Philharmonic&mdash;a position he would at the
time have been proud to accept. The decision of the
committee was now almost a foregone conclusion, though it
was not formally arrived at till the following year. What
it was may be told in the following extract from a letter
written to Av&eacute; Lallement on January 31, 1863, by Joachim,
whose influence with the committee had been energetically
exerted in favour of his Johannes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'... What can I say further about your plan with Stockhausen?
You know how highly I esteem his talent, and he
is certainly the best musician among the singers, but how
anyone, having to choose the director of a concert institution
between him and Johannes, can decide for the former, I,
with my limited musical understanding, cannot comprehend!
It is precisely as a man upon whom one can rely that I
regard Johannes so highly, with his gifts and his will!
There is nothing he cannot undertake, and, with his earnestness,
overcome! You know that as well as I, and if all of
you in the committee and orchestra had met him with
confidence and affection (as you, his friend, always do in
private) instead of with doubt and airs of protection, it
would have removed the asperity from his nature; whereas
it must constantly make him more bitter, with his touching,
almost childlike patriotism for Hamburg, to see himself
put second. I dare not dwell on the thought, it would make
me too unhappy, that his narrow compatriots have deprived
themselves of the means of making him more contented and
gentle, and happier in the exercise of his genius. I should
like to give the committee a moral cudgelling (and a bodily
one too!) for having left you in the lurch with your plan.
The slight to Johannes will not be forgotten in the history of
art! But basta!'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>To the advertisement of the Hamburg Philharmonic
programme of March 6, 1863, the words were added, 'Herr
Julius Stockhausen has kindly undertaken to conduct the
second and third numbers'; and a fortnight later Stockhausen's
appointment as capellmeister to the society for
the following season, 1863-64, was announced.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Johannes in Vienna may still, in the beginning
of November, 1862, have clung to hope in view of the forthcoming
performance of his serenade at the Gesellschaft
concert of the 14th under Herbeck. The reception of the
work proved, in fact, as favourable as might reasonably have
been expected. It was listened to with respect by public
and critics, and some of its parts, notably the first minuet,
were greeted with manifestations of decided approval.</p>

<p>'The serenade, a fine, interesting, and intellectual work,
deserved warmer acknowledgment,' wrote Speidel in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<i>Wiener Zeitung</i>. Hanslick, in the <i>Presse</i>, pronounced it one
of the most charming of modern orchestral compositions,
but took exception to the first subject of the opening movement,
as he had objected to that of the A major Quartet, as
being workable rather than original or significant.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The first minuet seems to us the pearl of the work and
perhaps the prettiest movement as yet written by Brahms.
The instrumental colouring and the grace of the melody
give it the characteristic of night music, and it is full of moonlight
and the scent of lilac.'</p>

<p>A remarkable review&mdash;remarkable from its admirable
appreciation of Brahms' creative personality&mdash;was despatched
to Leipzig by the Vienna correspondent of the
<i>Neue Zeitschrift</i>, who signs himself 'S.,' and appeared in the
Vienna r&eacute;sum&eacute; contained in the paper's issue of March 23:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'As regards Brahms' serenade which has been favourably
received, albeit in my opinion too severely criticised, only
thus much; it is one of the most charming examples, not
only of the class of composition from which it has sprung,
but of all that has followed Beethoven up to the comprehensive
conquests, as to contents and form, of the rising New
Germany.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It is fresh and rich in themes of which nearly every one is
pervaded by a rare grace, and a brightness of tone becoming
every day more unusual. The score convincingly exhibits,
moreover, one of the most prominent sides of Brahms'
musical individuality. I would call this a power of refashioning,
in the best spirit of the present day, the contrapuntal
forms of canon and fugue and of their degenerate
and inferior representatives. Brahms succeeds in this, as
in the majority of his works, in reconsecrating and carrying
on the spiritual treasure inherited from Bach, Beethoven
and Schumann, in the light of modernity. This fundamental
characteristic is still more striking in a second great work
of the composer, for the hearing of which opportunity is
promised. I will therefore go on to remark on the orchestral
colouring of the serenade, which, without being exaggerated,
is, throughout, fresh and significant of youthful power. I
should find it very difficult to express a preference for either
of the six movements, whilst to speak of either of the several
parts of this, in its way, masterly whole as inferior in excellence
to others, appears to me utterly impossible. The <i>vox
populi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> however, with which the principal journals here
coincide on this occasion, has pronounced in favour of the
first minuet and scherzo and the certainly wonderfully
tender slow movement.'</p>

<p>Brahms appeared on December 20 at Frau Passy-Cornet's
concert in the Vereinsaal, playing Beethoven's E flat Sonata
for pianoforte and violin with Hellmesberger, and some
Schumann solos (Romance and Novelette), and, in spite of
his frequently avowed distaste for public appearances, gave
a second concert on January 6, 1863, in order to bring
forward some of his songs. On this occasion he played
Bach's Chromatic Fantasia, Beethoven's C minor Variations,
his own Sonata in F minor Op. 5, and Schumann's Sonata
in the same key Op. 14, with omission of the scherzo.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms' playing,' wrote the Vienna correspondent of the
<i>Signale</i>, 'is always attractive and convincing. His rendering
of Bach's Chromatic Fantasia and of Beethoven's Variations
was of the highest interest.... After repeated recalls
Brahms treated his audience to another piece, a four-hand
march by Schubert arranged for two hands. The delightful
freshness of this composition gave no little pleasure.'</p>

<p>Frau Wilt, one of the first resident singers, performed
several of the concert-giver's songs, amongst them being
'Treue Liebe' (Op. 7, No. 1), 'Parole' (Op. 7, No. 2), and
'Liebestreue' ('O versenk,' Op. 3, No. 1).</p>

<p class="blockquot">'This new experience was most agreeable and welcome to
the whole public. All these songs breathe a fine sensibility,
and are full of truth to life and nature.'</p>

<p>This second concert, indeed, stamped Brahms' visit to
Vienna with the seal of decisive and permanent success&mdash;a
success not immediately wide or popular, but which marked
the beginning of a new epoch in the musical life of the city.
Though he could not stoop to the attempt to dazzle his public
by phenomenal feats of virtuosity, the grace, tenderness,
and truth of his musical nature appealed to his southern
audience, whilst the significance of his genius dawned on
the perception of one or two discerning musicians. In a
word, he had found a public which partially understood him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and a performance of the second serenade was announced
for one of the Philharmonic concerts.</p>

<p>Before the opening of the New Year, musical attention in
Vienna was turned to Richard Wagner, who conducted three
concerts devoted to selections from his own compositions,
and was received and discussed with the extremes of enthusiasm
and disapproval that usually attended his appearances
and the early productions of his works.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'One evening,' writes Hanslick many years later,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> 'when
we listened to Brahms' sextet after attending a concert of
excerpts from Wagner's "Tristan" in the afternoon, it was
as though we were suddenly transported to a world of pure
beauty.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> ... The general impression made in public by
the two men was almost as different as that of their music.
Brahms approached the conductor's desk with almost
awkward modesty; he responded reluctantly and doubtfully
to the most stormy calls and could not disappear again
quickly enough.'</p>

<p>The attraction felt by Hanslick for Brahms' art increased
with each opportunity of becoming acquainted with it. He
secured his services as pianist at a lecture on Beethoven&mdash;one
of a series&mdash;given by him in January, when Johannes,
whose pianistic r&eacute;pertoire was almost inexhaustible, performed
the thirty-three Variations on a waltz by Diabelli.</p>

<p>Wagner remained at Penzing, a suburb of Vienna, until
the spring, and Brahms, who was on cordial terms with
Tausig and Cornelius, paid him a visit in Tausig's company.
He was much pleased by Wagner's reception of him, and
spoke heartily of the pleasure he had found in his society.
There was no future personal intercourse between the two
composers, who were too widely separated by disposition,
tastes, and artistic faith to grow into intimacy, though it
should never be forgotten that Brahms felt, from first to
last, immense respect for Wagner's gifts and achievement.</p>

<p>One of our composer's engrossing occupations during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
nearly eight months' stay in Vienna was the study of
Schubert's manuscripts, which Spina was delighted to show
him, generously allowing him to copy from them for his own
pleasure as he felt inclined. Shortly before his return home
he sent some of the treasures thus obtained for Dietrich's
perusal.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... It occurs to me that I can send you my Marienlieder
and Variations for four hands which arrived lately, and I
enclose with them some extracts from an Easter cantata of
Schubert's which I copied from the manuscript. They are
not specially selected portions of Lazarus. By no means;
I merely wrote the beginning and end of the first part.
The music is as fine throughout; Simon's aria&mdash;oh, if I
could send you the whole, you would be enchanted with such
loveliness!...'</p>

<p>He decides to send in the same parcel, for Albert's inspection,
the string quintet which he had taken to Vienna to
get quite to his liking.</p>

<p>The second Serenade was announced for the Philharmonic
concert of March 8 as the opening number of the programme,
to be followed by Joachim's Hungarian Concerto, with Laub
as solo violinist, and this by a new symphony by M. K&auml;ssmeyer&mdash;an
astonishingly progressive list, which was due to
Dessoff's influence and was approvingly remarked upon by
Hanslick in his review of the 11th of the month. Meanwhile
difficulties presented themselves.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The discontent of
the members of the orchestra was apparent during the first
rehearsals of Brahms' work; complaints were heard of the
great difficulty of performing many of the passages, and at
the general rehearsal open mutiny broke out. The first
clarinettist suddenly rose, and, in the name of the body of
instrumentalists, declared their refusal to perform the composition.
Dessoff, white with agitation, instantly replied
by laying down his b&acirc;ton and announcing his resignation of
the post of conductor; Hellmesberger, as concertmeister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
followed suit, and the first flutist, Franz Doppler, a celebrated
performer, joined them. This decided matters.
The malcontents gave way, the rehearsal proceeded, and
the performance on the 8th was so greatly appreciated by the
public that R. Hirsch, who made his d&eacute;but as Brahms'
critic in the <i>Wiener Zeitung</i> in connexion with the occasion,
and who for many years systematically (and perhaps conscientiously)
decried his works, could find nothing worse to
say than that the serenade would find many friends amongst
those able to content themselves with modest gifts.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms should be on his guard against excess of things.
The exorbitant applause raised by his friends had the effect
of procuring him very loud hisses from other parties.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'If either of the younger composers has the right not to
be ignored, it is Brahms,' wrote Hanslick. 'He has
shown himself, in each of his lately-performed works, as an
independent, original individuality, a finely-organized, true,
musical nature, as an artist ripening towards mastership by
means of unwearied, conscious endeavour. His A major
Serenade is the younger, tender sister of the one in D lately
produced by the Gesellschaft and is conceived in the same
peaceful, dreamy garden mood.... The work had an
extremely favourable reception. The hearty applause
became proportionately greater at the close as the modest
composer made himself ever smaller in his seat in the gallery.'</p>

<p>Hanslick pronounced the Hungarian Concerto</p>

<p class="blockquot">'a tone-poem full of mind and spirit, of energy and tenderness.
One might almost regret Joachim's achievements as
a virtuoso, which must be the only cause that his powers
are so seldom concentrated on the composition of a great
work.'</p>

<p>The music season was now coming to a close, but the many
attractions of Vienna&mdash;and not least among them its beautiful
neighbourhood, with which Brahms' frequent long
walks with Nottebohm, Faber, Epstein, and others gradually
made him familiar&mdash;inclined him to stay on for some weeks
longer; and it was not until the spring had well set in that
he set out for Hanover <i>en route</i> for Hamburg, carrying
with him many new possessions as mementoes of his visit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
engravings of some of his favourite pictures in the Belvedere
Gallery,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and the entire collection of the then published
works of Schubert, presented to him by Spina, being the
principal. He had a particular reason for wishing to pass a
day or two with his friend. He was to be introduced to
Fr&auml;ulein Amalie Weiss, to whom Joachim had lately become
engaged. This lady had entered into a three years' engagement
as first contralto on the stage of the Hanover court
opera in the spring of 1862, and it was not long before her
gifts attracted the enthusiastic interest of the celebrated
court concertmeister of the same capital. The two artists
were betrothed in February, 1863, and the birthday of the
Queen of Hanover, April 14, was celebrated by a festival
performance of Gluck's 'Orpheus,' conducted, by Her
Majesty's express desire, by Joachim, in which Fr&auml;ulein
Weiss appeared with brilliant success in the title-r&ocirc;le.
Brahms, on his arrival a little later on, was a delighted
witness of a repetition of the opera. Frau Amalie Joachim,
who retired from the stage on her marriage (June, 1863),
gradually acquired a very great reputation as a concert-singer,
and was a much-admired interpreter of Brahms' songs.</p>

<p>Brahms returned to Hamburg on May 5, and, after passing
his thirtieth birthday with his family, took a lodging at
Blankenese, on the Elbe, where an unexpected meeting with
some of the former members of his Ladies' Choir agreeably
reminded him of the charming society that had now quite
fallen through, having served its purpose in the composer's
course of self-training. Various plans for work and recreation
for the summer and autumn months were under consideration,
but were to be set aside. Before the month was
out, Brahms received a convincing proof of the impression
his visit had made in Vienna by getting a call to return there.
The post of conductor to the Singakademie had fallen vacant
by the death of Stegmayer, and, at the general meeting of the
society in the course of May, Brahms was elected successor
to the post. There was a severe competition between two
sections of the members, a large and influential party, led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
by Prince Constantin Czartoriska, being strongly in favour
of the election of Franz Krenn, an excellent musician of
the old school, who belonged to Vienna as choir-master of
the parish church of St. Michael, and professor of composition
at the conservatoire, and who had conducted one of
the Singakademie concerts during Stegmayer's illness. It
happened, however, that amongst those members of the
committee who desired that the practices and performances
of the society should be placed under the direction of a young,
resolute, and energetic musician, were several gentlemen
belonging to the circle of enthusiastic admirers of Brahms'
art which had sprung into existence almost simultaneously
with his first appearance in Vienna, and had increased with
each opportunity that had offered itself there for the hearing
of his music. Amongst them were Dr. Scholz, a surgeon;
Herr Adolf Schultz, a merchant; and Herr Franz Flatz, an
insurance official of Vienna; and at their head Dr. Josef
G&auml;nsbacher, son of the distinguished musician and church
composer Johann G&auml;nsbacher, the pupil of Vogler and
Albrechtsberger, acquaintance of Haydn and Beethoven,
friend of Weber and Meyerbeer, and capellmeister of the
cathedral from 1823 until his death in 1844.</p>

<p>Dr. Josef G&auml;nsbacher, whose name has become known
in the musical world of many countries by its appearance on
the title-page of Brahms' first sonata for pianoforte and
violoncello, was, in 1863, a young doctor of jurisprudence
and advocate's draughtsman. Later on he adopted music
as a profession, and became a valued teacher of singing,
professor at the conservatoire, and violoncellist. He was
one of Brahms' earliest and truest friends in Vienna, and
became a devotee of his art even before making his personal
acquaintance. He had considerable influence with the
members of the Singakademie, and representatives of both
sections of the committee called on him at his bureau to
solicit his help, Prince Czartoriska presenting himself in
person in Krenn's favour. G&auml;nsbacher's sympathies, however,
were all the other way; and, being selected by his
party to make a speech at the general meeting in Brahms'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
interest, he used such forcible arguments as to bring over
several of Krenn's supporters and to win the election for his
own side by a majority of one.</p>

<p>It was in every way characteristic of our composer that
he could not at once decide either to accept or reject the
offer of the appointment, and was only at length brought to
a resolution by a telegraphic request for his final answer.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The resolve to give away one's freedom for the first time
is exceptional,' he wrote to the committee, 'but anything
coming from Vienna sounds doubly pleasant to a musician
and whatever may call him thither is doubly attractive.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Something of what it cost Brahms to send his affirmative
decision may be perceived in a letter to Hanslick, which
indicates, also, the quick advance of friendship between the
two men:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'You will wonder that most glad and grateful reply
has not arrived sooner to yours and many other kind letters
received by me. I seem to myself as one who has been
praised beyond desert, and should like to creep into hiding
for awhile. I resolved, on receipt of the telegraphic despatch
... to be content with such a flattering summons and not
to tempt the gods further ... and since nothing more is
in question than whether I have the courage to say "yes,"
it shall be so. Had I refused, my reasons would not have
been understood by the academy or by you Viennese
generally....'</p>

<p>These occurrences put an end to the various holiday
projects which Brahms had been considering. 'I cannot
make up my mind to deprive my parents of any of our
short time together,' he wrote in answer to Dietrich's
pressing invitation, and remained quietly near and at
Hamburg. He began at once to occupy himself with plans
for his programmes, and begged Dietrich's advice 'as a very
experienced and learned court-conductor' on matters connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
with his new duties. 'I feel enormously diffident,'
he says, 'about trying my talent for these things in Vienna.'</p>

<p>Allowing himself but three days <i>en route</i> for a visit to
beautiful Lichtenthal, a suburb of Baden-Baden, where
Frau Schumann had purchased a house the previous year
on giving up her residence in Berlin, Brahms was back again
in Vienna by the last week of August, and soon engaged with
characteristic earnestness in work connected with his new
appointment. His scheme for the weekly practices of the
Singakademie season included works by Bach, Beethoven,
Mendelssohn, Schumann, and masters of the earlier period
whose music was a speciality of the society. The first
concert of the season 1863-64, given on November 15 under
his direction, presented the following programme:</p>

<table style="width:90%;" border="0" summary="Programme from November 15, 1863">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Schumann:</td>
    <td>'Requiem f&uuml;r Mignon.' (First time in Vienna.)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The co-operating artists were Frau Wilt and Frau Ferrari;
Herr Danzer, Herr Dalfy, and Herr Organist Bibl. No
doubt could be felt at the close of the performances of
Brahms' gifts as a conductor.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The concert was not only excellent in itself, but was,
with exception of the first performance in Vienna of Bach's
"Matthew Passion," by far the most noteworthy achievement
in the record of the Singakademie, and gave us
the opportunity of recognising Brahms' rare talent as a
conductor.'</p>

<p>Bach's cantata was rendered 'with splendid colouring and
spiritual insight'; the three delightful Volkslieder 'opened
all hearts.' These were received with such stormy applause
that a fourth, not less acceptable, was added. Considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
surprise seems to have been excited, not by the conductor's
inspired conception of the works performed, but by the
precision and clearness of his beat, which, remarks one critic,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'could hardly have been expected of an artist who has shown
himself, in his creations and performances, so essentially a
romanticist and dreamer.'</p>

<p>These last words sound strange as coming from a writer
in Vienna who may be supposed to have gained some
knowledge of the serenades, the B flat sextet, and the two
pianoforte quartets, and they are quoted, not because of
their aptness, but as illustrating a difficulty which the composer's
individuality, reflected in his works as in a mirror,
caused for many a long year to some of his less competent,
even though friendly, critics&mdash;the difficulty of knowing how
to classify him. From an early period his determination
was strong to bring the womanly tenderness and dreamy
romance that were in him under the complete control of his
energetic will, to give supreme dominance in art, as in life,
to understanding rather than to emotion, to possess and be
master of his powers; but, during the earlier years of his
activity, the subtle poetic charm dwelling within his works
made itself felt by many sympathetic listeners who could
not immediately follow their closely-woven texture, and who
were puzzled by his independent treatment&mdash;at times almost
amounting to a re-creation&mdash;of traditional form. Hence,
he has not seldom been spoken of as essentially a romanticist
long since his position as the representative descendant of
Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven was recognised by those most
competent to judge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his art was gradually spreading through
Europe. On November 10 the first serenade was given at
Z&uuml;rich under Fichtelberger, the conductor of the subscription
concerts. The work deserved a warmer reception than
was accorded it, in the opinion of the <i>Neuer Z&uuml;rcher Zeitung</i>,
whose critic recognised in Brahms a composer, not only of
profound knowledge, but of inborn genius. He did not
commit himself to pronouncement as to whether the composer's
creative power would be of sufficient force to discover
really 'new paths,' or would prove better qualified for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
making further developments within the already conquered
domain of musical art, but thought the serenade pointed to
the latter probability.</p>

<p>The B flat Sextet was performed at a concert given in
Hamburg in November by Ros&eacute; and Stockhausen, whose
friendship with Brahms had not been allowed to suffer by
the action of the Philharmonic committee. The composition
was given in Vienna at the Hellmesberger concert of
December 27, when it awakened extraordinary interest and
sympathy. In the Austrian capital, as elsewhere, it was the
first of the composer's important works to become popular.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve was passed with the Fabers, Brahms being,
as ever, the most cordial, happy, childlike guest. He continued,
during the first years of his subsequent residence in
Vienna, to spend the festival with these friends, who took
pains to invite his favourite companions to meet him.
Nottebohm was always of the party. Amongst his presents
one Christmas for the gift-making ceremony at home in
Hamburg, was a sewing-machine for his sister, who had
expressed a wish for such a possession as a help in her employment.
After the lapse of a few seasons, however, Brahms
for a great many years habitually declined all invitations
for Christmas Eve, only breaking his rule by occasionally
spending it with Frau Schumann. Within the last decade
of his life he again changed his custom, and passed the
evening regularly in the happy home circle of some friends
to whom the reader will be introduced in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The second and third concerts of the Singakademie took
place on January 6 and March 20, with the subjoined programmes:</p>

<p>They do not seem to have been so successful as the first.
The public found the programme of January 6 monotonous.
Hirsch, in his notice of the concert in the <i>Wiener Zeitung</i>,
goes so far as to speak of 'shipwreck,' while Hanslick himself
owns that the performance of the earlier numbers had
the 'character of an improvisation or a practice rather
than a concert production.' The three German folk-songs
(the two last harmonized by Brahms) were so warmly
received that the conductor's Minnelied, 'Der Holdseliger'
was given in addition. The success of the Bach cantata was
injured by a contretemps. The B&ouml;rsendorfer piano, sent
in the absence of an organ, was too high in pitch and therefore
unavailable.</p>

<p>The concert of March 20, at which the Christmas Oratorio
was given, seems to have been rather overshadowed by the
performance of Bach's 'St. John's Passion' by the Gesellschaft
forces at a somewhat earlier date.</p>

<p>The satisfaction and confidence extended to the conductor
by the Akademie remained undiminished, however, by the
falling-off in the success of the second and third public
performances, and were expressed at the close of the subscription
season by the arrangement of an extra concert devoted
to Brahms' compositions. The instrumental numbers on
this occasion were the B flat Sextet, played by the Hellmesberger
party, and a Sonata for two pianofortes&mdash;in reality
the arrangement in this form of the manuscript string
quintet with two violoncelli, to which reference has already
been made. Tausig, a great admirer of Brahms' genius, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
took the Paganini Variations under his especial care later
on, was the composer's colleague in the performance, for
which, therefore, every advantage was secured; but Brahms
had not yet, as it seemed, found the right medium for the
expression of his thoughts. The sonata fell flat, making no
impression on the audience. There were several vocal
numbers, and amongst them was the charming 'Wechsellied
zum Tanze,' No. 1 of the three Quartets for solo voices,
Op. 31, which stand in an anticipatory relation to the
'Liebeslieder.' They show Brahms in his graceful, playful,
genial mood. The 'Wechsellied' is in dance measure, and
has two alternative melodies severally adapted to the
character of Goethe's verses&mdash;the first in E flat, allotted to
the contralto and bass, the 'indifferent' pair; the second in
A flat, to the soprano and tenor, the 'tender' pair. Brahms
has delightfully expressed the difference of mood animating
the two couples, and, by the simple device of writing the
first of the two little duets in imitation, the bass following
the contralto at a bar's distance, has suggested a tone of
bright enjoyment which contrasts effectively with the
romantic spirit of the lovers' song. The four voices combine
towards the close of the composition, which comes to an
end in the key of the lover's melody.</p>

<p>No. 2 of the same opus&mdash;'Neckereien' (Raillery), the
text of which is a Moorish folk-song, is full of graceful fun.
In this the tenors and basses alternate with the sopranos
and contraltos; the youths court the girls, who will rather
be transformed into little doves, little fishes, little hares,
than have anything to do with them. The suitors, on the
other hand, hint that such changes may be of small avail
against little guns, little nets, little dogs.</p>

<p>No. 3, also set to a national text, this time Bohemian, is
a charming four-part song, with a graceful accompaniment
in waltz rhythm, and is developed from the melody used by
Brahms in No. 5 of his set of waltzes for pianoforte. These
quartets were composed at Detmold.</p>

<p>On May 10 the annual foundation concert of the Singakademie
took place&mdash;as usual, before a private audience.

<p>The fourth and fifth numbers of the programme were no
doubt selected by Brahms from a collection of early English
madrigals, edited by J. J. Maier of Munich.</p>

<p>Our composer's appointment as conductor of the Singakademie
lapsed at the end of the season. By the rules
of the society, election took place triennially, and Stegmayer's
death had left only a year to run. Brahms' re-election
was a matter of course, and was accepted by him,
though not without doubt and hesitation; but his resolution
failed him later on, and before the end of the summer he
sent his resignation to the committee.</p>

<p>In the course of the year, Spina of Vienna (Cranz of
Hamburg) published a setting of the 13th Psalm for three-part
women's Chorus, with accompaniment for organ or pianoforte;
and four Duets for Contralto and Baritone, dedicated
to Frau Amalie Joachim. Breitkopf and H&auml;rtel issued
two Motets for five-part mixed Chorus <i>a capella</i> (the first
set to a verse of a church hymn by Paul Speratus, 1484-1551;
the second to words from the 51st Psalm); a Sacred
Song by Paul Fleming, 1609-1640 (set for two-part mixed
Chorus, and written in double canon); and the three Quartets
for Solo voices to which we have already referred as Op. 31.</p>

<p>Rieter-Biedermann published a set of nine Songs (Op. 32),
No. 9 of which is the exquisite 'Wie bist du meine K&ouml;nigin,'
one of the most fragrant love-songs ever composed; and a
set of German Folk-songs, without opus number, dedicated
to the Vienna Singakademie.</p>

<p>An Organ Fugue in A flat minor was published as a supplement
to No. 29 of the <i>Allgemeine Musikzeitung</i>, edited, as
the reader may remember, by Selmar Bagge.</p>

<p>In the year 1864, or possibly at the end of 1863, the domestic
troubles that had arisen from Jakob Brahms' early marriage
with a delicate woman nearly twenty years his senior came
to a crisis which Johannes, loving both father and mother
with tender devotion, could no longer bear. By his wish
the ill-assorted couple separated. Jakob had long since
become fairly prosperous in a small way, holding a recognised
position as a double-bass player amongst the orchestral
musicians of Hamburg, and had even been appointed a
member of the Philharmonic band since Stockhausen's
election as the society's conductor. He now found quarters
for himself in the Grosser Bleichen; the home in the
Fuhlentwiethe was given up. Fritz, who, in spite of his
want of energy, was doing well as a teacher, took lodgings
in Theaterstrasse, and Frau Brahms and Elise removed to
comfortable rooms in the Lange Reihe, Johannes, poor as
he was, taking upon himself the sole responsibility of their
maintenance. The time was still distant, in spite of the
composer's steadily-growing fame, when his circumstances
were to become prosperous. Had money-making been one
of his immediate objects, he could certainly have attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
it with little difficulty; but his aims were wholly ideal, and
directly included pecuniary profit only so far as this was
necessary for his own decent maintenance and for the exercise
of ungrudging generosity to his family. His income,
derived from the sale of his copyrights and from his public
activity as a pianist&mdash;for he practically gave up teaching
on going to Vienna&mdash;sufficed for these ends; he had learned
from early youth to find happiness in the realities of life,
and to treat as superfluities as many things as possible. The
cultivation of happiness he viewed, not only as a part of
wisdom, but as a duty. 'Let us, so far as we may, retain a
fresh, happy interest in life, which we have at any rate to
live' was not with him a mere phrase to be offered for the
benefit of a friend in trouble, but one of the abiding principles
by which he shaped his own daily existence.</p>

<p>No year would have been possible to Brahms without sight
of his parents and he stayed near them for part of the
summer, his first visit after embracing father and mother
being, as usual, to Marxsen. Further plans were not
difficult to arrange, and chief among them was that of a long
visit to Baden-Baden. 'Johannes took us by surprise on
July 30' is Frau Schumann's entry, in her diary, of his arrival.
He stayed on for the remainder of the season, residing in a
charming villa close to the grounds of the Kurhaus, which
was placed at his disposal by Rubinstein, who had taken it
for the summer, but left in August.</p>

<p>Frau Schumann's residence at Baden-Baden brought in
its train results which are of much interest in the history of
Brahms' career. The not-distant capital of the duchy of
Baden, Carlsruhe, was to become, in the course of the next
few years, an important centre for the cultivation of his art.
It seems convenient, therefore, to mention at once the names
of a few members of a group of friends belonging to Frau
Schumann's circle who resided or stayed frequently in the
neighbourhood, and with whom Brahms became more or
less intimate.</p>

<p>Jakob Rosenhain (born 1813), a composer now forgotten,
but esteemed in his day, and recognised both by Schumann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and Mendelssohn, lived at Baden-Baden, and was sometimes
to be met at Frau Schumann's house. His name heads the
programme of Johannes' first public concert of 1848. The
painter Anselm Feuerbach (1829-1880), a little-known and
disappointed man in 1864, whose art has attained great posthumous
celebrity, came annually with his mother to pass
a few weeks there. The name of Frau Henriette Feuerbach
appears on the title-page of Brahms' work 'N&auml;nie,' which
was composed soon after the premature death of her son.
With the mention of Feuerbach must be associated that of
Julius Allgeyer, introduced to our readers in an early chapter
as a student of copperplate engraving at D&uuml;sseldorf, and
now settled in Carlsruhe as a high-art photographer.
Allgeyer had a genius for friendship. He was extraordinarily
attached to Feuerbach, of whose art he made
himself the apostle; but though his four years' residence
in Rome (1856-1860) in close intercourse with the painter
caused an interruption of his personal intimacy with Brahms,
the two men remained in occasional correspondence, and
held each other in cordial esteem. Now the old friendship
was renewed, and it was not long before Brahms came to
occupy a place in the engraver's affections second only to
that of Feuerbach. The thought that he had known and
loved both musician and painter through the period of their
dawning fame was, in after-years, a source of satisfaction and
pride to Allgeyer, whose name has become well known in
Germany as that of Feuerbach's biographer.</p>

<p>In the middle of the sixties Carlsruhe, under the encouragement
of its reigning Grand-Duke Frederick, occupied an
exceptionally brilliant position amongst the smaller European
centres of dramatic and musical art, to which it had been
raised by the talents and devotion of Edward Devrient, the
eminent stage-director of its court theatre, whose name may
be familiar to some English readers as that of one of Mendelssohn's
intimate friends. A man of wide general culture, the
author of the standard work on its subject&mdash;'The History of
German Dramatic Art'&mdash;playwright, singer, actor, possessed
of an intimate knowledge of the best traditions of the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
stage in the wide sense that includes opera, which had been
derived from thirty years of professional association with the
court theatres of Berlin and Dresden, Devrient was an ideal
man for his post. His own sympathies remained faithful to
the classical school of opera upon which his taste had been
formed, but he did not allow his devotion to Gluck and Mozart
and his interest in the revival of works of an early period to
narrow the sphere of his activity. Taking a broad view of
the duties of his position, he recognised the claim to hearing
of the New-German school, and several of Wagner's musical
dramas had been performed in the Carlsruhe court theatre
by his permission, if not on his initiative, before his resignation
of his post soon after the celebration of his artistic
jubilee in April, 1869.</p>

<p>Not the least of his services to music was his choice of a
successor to the post of court capellmeister at Carlsruhe,
which fell vacant on the resignation of Joseph Strauss (not
of the celebrated Vienna family) early in 1864. By recommending
Hermann Levi (1839-1900) for the appointment,
famous after the middle of the seventies amongst the famous
Wagner conductors, and director of the first performances of
'Parsifal' (July-August, 1882), and by the generosity with
which he permitted the youthful musician to profit by the
fruits of his own ripe experience, he contributed in no small
degree towards perfecting the technical education of an
artist whose name will be remembered in musical history
as amongst those of the great in his chosen branch of
activity.</p>

<p>A gifted pupil of the Leipzig Conservatoire, Levi resolved,
at an early age, to aim at achieving distinction as a conductor,
and, on entering the service of the Grand-Duke of Baden in
his twenty-sixth year, he had already laid the foundation
of his future celebrity in successive posts at Saarbr&uuml;ck,
Mannheim, and Rotterdam. He had a large and enthusiastic
nature which caused him to reject the formal and
stereotyped in art and to sympathize with what seemed to
him genuinely progressive, and, becoming early in his career
a great admirer of Schumann's music, he passed easily to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
recognition of the genius of Brahms, with whom he had a
slight acquaintance before settling at Carlsruhe.</p>

<p>The singer Hauser, the violoncellist Lindner, the hornist
Segisser, the authoress Fr&auml;ulein Anna Ettlinger&mdash;all resident
in Carlsruhe&mdash;the learned Oberschulrath Gustav Wendt,
called there in 1867, whose rooms were the scene of many
distinguished gatherings, are to be included in our list; and
of particular interest is the name of the violoncellist Bernhard
Cossmann, of Weimar celebrity, who settled at Baden-Baden
in 1870. Brahms was a willing and heartily welcome visitor
at his house, and took part there in performances of his
E minor Violoncello Sonata, and, with the hornist Steinbr&uuml;gger,
of the Horn Trio.</p>

<p>A noteworthy and picturesque figure, familiar in the artist
circle, was that of Tourgenieff, who visited Baden-Baden
annually from early in the sixties until the opening of the
seventies. In conclusion is to be added the name of Pauline
Viardot-Garcia, who settled at Baden in 1863, building a
spacious villa in the Lichtenthaler All&eacute;e for her summer
residence, which contained a gallery of fine paintings,
chiefly of the Spanish and Netherlands schools. Amongst her
possessions was Mozart's autograph score of 'Don Giovanni,'
which she kept enshrined in a valuable casket. Madame
Viardot was a musician in a very comprehensive sense of
the word. Her triumphs on the operatic stage belong to
the history of musico-dramatic art; she had been a pupil
of Liszt on the pianoforte, had studied counterpoint and
composition, and composed a good deal. Several of her
operettas, for which Tourgenieff furnished the text-books,
were performed privately by her pupils and children in her
miniature theatre in Baden-Baden, where she was accustomed
to entertain many of the celebrities of the time. One
was given in German translation by Richard Pohl, as 'Der
letzte Zauberer,' on the Court stages of Carlsruhe and
Weimar. At the request of some of her girl pupils, Brahms
composed a short choral serenade for her birthday one
summer subsequent to our present date, and conducted its
performance by the young ladies, outside her house, at an early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
hour of the morning. This pleasant incident of the seventies
recalls that of the forties, when the youthful Johannes
consented to fill the offices of composer and conductor at
Winsen on the occasion of Rector K&ouml;hler's birthday.</p>

<p>Brahms was presented by Frau Schumann, in the course of
this his first lengthened stay at Baden-Baden, to the Princess
Anna, Landgr&auml;fin of Hesse on an occasion when the two artists
performed his sonata for two pianofortes privately before Her
Royal Highness. The work, which, as we have seen, had
failed to win public sympathy when performed in a Vienna
concert-room, made its mark on this occasion. It appealed
strongly to the royal listener, who, at the close of the last
movement, warmly expressed to the composer her sense of
its beauty. Brahms, gratified and pleased at the Princess's
unreserved appreciation, called on her the following day, and
begged permission, which was readily granted, to dedicate
the work to her; and on its publication the following year
in its final form&mdash;a quintet for pianoforte and strings&mdash;Her
Royal Highness's name appeared on the title-page. The
Princess acknowledged the compliment of the dedication
by presenting Brahms with one of her treasures&mdash;the autograph
score of Mozart's G minor Symphony. It passed
after his death, as part of his library, into the possession of
the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, Vienna.</p>

<p>An interesting reference to the dedication and the time
is in the possession of the present Landgraf of Hesse, whose
musical talent was recognised and encouraged by Brahms
twenty years later, and is contained in a letter of thanks
written by the master in 1892 on the dedication to him of a
fantasia for pianoforte published that year by the Prince:</p>

<p class="blockquot center">'<span class="smcap">Your Royal Highness<br /><span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">Most gracious Herr Landgraf!</span></span>
</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Whilst I venture to express to Your Royal Highness
my most respectful and hearty thanks for the dedication
of the fantasia, very many and very pleasant recollections
occur to me.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The high and agreeable distinction, as which I regard
the dedication, reminds me of the similar pleasure I experienced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>when I was permitted to inscribe my quintet to your
highly-honoured mother, the Frau Landgr&auml;fin. That was
in beautiful Baden-Baden, and it would be too tempting
to go on chatting about the unforgettable music-hours and
pleasant days; but much else crowds upon the memory:
Meiningen, Frankfurt, Vienna, Baden, etc. I think that
by my mere mention of these names Y.R.H. will know what
a valued memorial your work and its dedication, by which
I am so much honoured, will be to me of many pleasant
times.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'With my hearty thanks for the valuable present, I unite
the wish that our glorious art may bring to Y.R.H. many
more hours as happy as those were of which this fantasia
gives such convincing testimony.</p>

<p>On September 12 Frau Joachim's first child was born,
and there was no doubt as to what he should be called.
Johannes must, of course, be godfather, and give his name
to Joachim's boy. Brahms was not present at the christening,
but he sent to the parents as his congratulatory gift the
manuscript of the little song published long afterwards as
No. 2 of Op. 91, the 'Geistliches Wiegenlied,' or, as it is
called in the published translated title, 'The Virgin's
Cradle Song.' The words are imitated by Geibel from a
text of Lope de Vega, 'Die ihr schwebt um diese Palmen'
(Ye who o'er these palms are hov'ring). The music, composed
for contralto, viola, and pianoforte, is founded upon
the melody of an old song,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which, given in Brahms' composition
to the viola, serves as the basis for the contrapuntal
treatment of the voice and pianoforte parts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Brahms left Baden-Baden on October 10, and, returning
to Vienna, passed the next few weeks in quiet pursuit of his
ordinary avocations, happy at knowing himself in complete
possession of his time, yet perhaps not without an occasional
passing regret at the thought of the pleasure he had derived
the previous season, as conductor of the Singakademie, from
his association with choir and orchestra. The change he
had advised in the family arrangements at Hamburg was
not greatly to prolong for his mother the peaceful old age
he had desired to secure for her. Frau Brahms had taken
her last farewell of her dearly-loved son when he quitted
Hamburg in the summer. Her health, which had for some
time been growing weaker, continued to fail, and on
February 2, 1865, she quietly breathed her last.</p>

<p>Johannes, who took the next train to Hamburg after
receiving his sister's summons, arrived soon after all was
over, and turned immediately towards his mother's bed-chamber.
He had once before passed through a great
sorrow, but in Schumann's case death had come in the
guise of a friend. This was another kind of bereavement,
and the loss of the dear, simply-loving old mother wrung
his heart. 'Do not go in yet, Hannes,' said Elise, trying
to prevent him, and, indeed, as he passed on into the room
the sudden complete realization of the mother's tenderness
gone from his life broke down his self-command on the
instant. He knelt down by the quiet bed and sobbed aloud
in uncontrollable grief. When he had somewhat collected
himself he presently went out. Solitude, however, often
welcome to him, was not what he wanted to-day, nor over-much
sympathy, but affection&mdash;and affection of a kind
that perhaps may have seemed to him something akin to
the assured, unreasoning mother's love. He turned into
kind Frau Cossel's and asked her to let him have a child.
His own little goddaughter Johanna was most willingly
at his service as a companion, and as soon as she was ready
the pair walked away together hand in hand back to Elise,
the little girl somewhat awed by the situation and the
changed demeanour of the friend whom she was accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to regard as the merriest of her companions, but glad
to be in his society on any terms. Leaving his godchild
with Elise, Johannes almost immediately went out again, and
returned after a while with his father, whom he drew with
him into the adjoining room, accidentally leaving the door
of communication a little open. The scene of the death-chamber
was thus made visible to the frightened Johanna
from her position in the parlour, and imprinted itself
indelibly on her brain. She watched it spellbound, and
was not too young a child to be penetrated and touched
by what she saw.</p>

<p>The two men stood together by the bedside for a few
seconds without stirring. Then Johannes, putting his hand
on his father's arm, gently guided it towards the motionless
figure, and, placing the husband's hand over that of the
dead wife, kept both covered with his own in a last reconciliation.
Kind friends came to the funeral, and true
sympathy was at hand, but Johannes shrank in his grief
from hearing the expression of condolence. 'I have no
mother now: I must marry,' he said miserably when the
service was over. Stockhausen and his wife insisted that
he and Elise should dine quietly with them that day, and
there is little doubt that Brahms was helped by the affectionate
consideration shown on all sides, and was quietly
grateful for it. He returned to his work in a few days,
but the responsibility for the maintenance of Elise, who,
having strongly felt the mother's side of the family difficulties,
shrank from the idea of rejoining her father,
remained entirely his.</p>

<p>The two first books of the 'Magelone Romances,' dedicated
to Stockhausen, and the Pianoforte Quintet were published
by Rieter-Biedermann early in the year. The version of
the quintet as a Sonata for two Pianofortes was issued by
the same house in 1872.</p>

<p>The Quintet in F minor, Op. 34, is unquestionably one
of the greatest works of chamber music for pianoforte and
strings ever written. Some distinguished writers go so far
as to give it the first place amongst the composer's works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of its class; and if regard be had to the largeness of its proportions,
the stormy grandeur and the deep pathos of its
ideas, its extraordinary wealth of thematic material, and
the astonishing power with which this is handled, it must
be admitted that there is something to be said in support
of such a view. To the author it certainly appears impossible
to select one of Brahms' works of this period and this
class for preference as compared with the others. All are
so great as, so to say, to defy future competition. They
seem as unapproachable and secure on their own lines as
the immortal '48' themselves in another category. The
imaginative power which surges through the first movement
of the quintet recalls the daring of the youthful
Johannes, and is guided now by a master-hand. This
movement dominates the whole work. Its contrasted
tones of passionate splendour and scarcely less passionate
mystery are reflected in the rich pathos of the 'andante
un poco adagio,' in the weird fitfulness of the scherzo with
its heart-gripping trio, and in the doubtful tranquillity of
the finale, bursting in the coda into a rushing impetuosity
which carries the movement to a triumphant conclusion.
Few of Brahms' compositions contain more striking illustrations
than this one of his power of fertilizing his themes
and bringing new, out of previous, material, a power which
gives to his works a coherence and solidity hardly equalled
save in the compositions of Bach himself, and which has
a certain artistic analogy with the secret force that governs
all natural organic development.</p>

<p>The summer of this year was again spent near Frau
Schumann. Brahms took lodgings&mdash;two small rooms well
provided with windows&mdash;in Frau Becker's house, which
was situated a little apart from the village of Lichtenthal
in an idyllic spot amongst the hills. His plan of life,
essentially the same wherever he fixed his summer residence,
was to rise with the dawn, and, after making himself an
early cup of coffee, to enjoy the fresh delights of early
morning by going for a long walk in the surrounding forest.
He then returned to work in his rooms until the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
arrived for his mid-day dinner, taken usually in the garden
of the 'Golden Lion'; for in these days he only dined occasionally,
when accompanied by a friend, at the somewhat
more expensive 'Bear.' By four o'clock he was generally
in Frau Schumann's balcony for afternoon coffee and to
pass an hour with her in music, conversation, or walking.
More often than not he returned to supper at half-past
seven, when his place was laid at table, as a matter of course,
at Frau Schumann's right hand.</p>

<p>All the circumstances of his surroundings were favourable
to his creative activity, which was unceasing, and the
profound emotional experience that had recently moved
and enriched his spirit had already caused in him the
stirrings of the impulse that was to grow and gradually
to dominate him until it had become embodied in a work
which, had it been the only child of his genius known to
the world, would have sufficed to immortalize his name.</p>

<p>Before Brahms' departure from Lichtenthal a communication
from Hamburg added to his feelings of tenderness and
regret the shadow of a grave family apprehension.</p>

<p>Having accepted engagements in Switzerland and Germany
for the ante-Christmas concert-season, he remained
on till the end of October in his quarters at Frau Becker's,
and here, about a week before the commencement of his
<i>tourn&eacute;e</i>, he received the news that his father had resolved
to marry again, and had become engaged to a widow. The
intelligence, such as it was, came direct from Jakob, but
it contained no particulars whatever to soften the anxiety
it aroused, no mention being made in it even of the name
of the intended wife, and it threw the son into a state of
the strongest agitation, in which the tender pang for the
dear old mother may very possibly not have been the predominating
element. Who could the wife-elect be? Would
she make Jakob happy? Could the marriage state be
happy except under the rarest combination of circumstances?
Were there children of the widow's first marriage
to be provided for? if so, by whom? Jakob's means
could bear no additional burden. And yet, the dear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
homely, uncultured father, often enough a butt for the wit
of the younger musicians standing by his side in the Philharmonic
orchestra; this musician without musical endowment,
who loved his music and his instruments, as Johannes
sometimes declared, if such affection were to be measured
by proof given, better even than he himself loved his art;
who had persevered doggedly through long years of privation
and struggle in his endeavours to attain to some small
place in the world of art, and had won it, his father&mdash;and
it needs no prophet to realize the pathos of this thought to
the loving heart of the great composer&mdash;did he not deserve
happiness if happiness should follow the step? Johannes
was that day capable of but two resolutions on the subject:
first, that his father should be made happy if anything he
could say or do could help to make him so, and, secondly,
that as soon as his engagements should permit, he would
go to Hamburg and judge for himself of the wisdom of
Jakob's choice.</p>

<p>The first of Brahms' concert undertakings for the autumn
was fulfilled on November 3 in the hall of the Museum,
Carlsruhe, where he performed his Pianoforte Concerto at
the first subscription concert of the season, accompanied
by the grand-ducal orchestra under Levi. The work was
received, for the first time, with every sign of approval.
'The people had the surprising kindness to be quite
satisfied, to call for me, praise me, and all the rest of it,'
he wrote to Dietrich.</p>

<p>Two of the vocal quartets, Op. 31, were included in the
programme, and Brahms played some unaccompanied
Schumann solos in the second part of the concert.</p>

<p>On the 6th of the month two new 'Magelone Romances'
were sung for the first time in public by Krause, at a concert
given in the same hall by Frau Schumann and Joachim;
and before Brahms left Carlsruhe the first private performance
took place of the newly-completed Trio in E flat
for pianoforte, violin, and horn, a composition which has
now long occupied a peculiar place in the affection of
genuine lovers of his music on account of the tone of pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
beauty that pervades it&mdash;beauty of sound, of mood, and
idea. The noble simplicity of its themes and the spontaneous
character which distinguishes their development
hold the attention even of the unfamiliar listener from
beginning to end of this inspired work, and the great
musicianship of the composer has wrought it to a flawless
example of its kind, in which no weak spot can be detected
by deliberate examination. The adagio has the character
of a lament, and can hardly be matched as an expression
of profound sadness excepting by a few others of Brahms'
and some of Beethoven's slow movements. The work was
a favourite with the composer, and it is of interest to know
from his own lips that its inception was due to an inspiration
that came to him in the course of one of his walks
near Lichtenthal. A year or two later than our present
date, as he was ascending one of his beloved pine-clad
hills in Dietrich's company, he showed his friend the exact
spot where the opening theme of the first movement had
occurred to him, saying: 'I was walking along one morning,
and as I came to this spot the sun shone out and the subject
immediately suggested itself.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>From Carlsruhe Brahms proceeded to Switzerland, where
he appeared at Basle, Z&uuml;rich, and Winterthur. At Z&uuml;rich
he conducted his D major Serenade, given there two years
previously under Fichtelberger, and performed the solo of
Schumann's Pianoforte Concerto, and Bach's Chromatic
Fantasia; and at Winterthur he gave a chamber music
soir&eacute;e in combination with his friend Theodor Kirchner
and the young violinist F. Hegar. Of this Widmann, who
saw and heard Brahms for the first time on the occasion,
has given some account in his 'Recollections.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'There was,' he writes, 'a something in his countenance
which suggested the certainty of victory, the beaming
cheerfulness of a poet happy in the exercise of his art.'</p>

<p>Returning to Germany, Brahms appeared next at Mannheim,
and, on December 12, conducted his D major Serenade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and played Beethoven's E flat Concerto at the fifth G&uuml;rzenich
subscription concert of the season at Cologne. He had but
little success on this occasion either as pianist or composer.
The serenade was criticised as being too lengthy and its
themes as too 'na&iuml;ve' for his elaborate treatment of them.
A different reception was accorded him at a soir&eacute;e of chamber
music held at the conservatoire, when he performed with
Hiller his Duet Variations, Op. 23, and with von K&ouml;nigslow
and his colleagues the G minor Pianoforte Quartet. Both
works were received with acclamation, and the composer
achieved a success worthy of his position in the world of art.
Before leaving Cologne Brahms played at a meeting of the
Musikverein to a private audience of the members, most
of them professors and students of the conservatoire.
Amongst the pieces chosen by him for performance on this
occasion were Bach's great Organ Prelude and Fugue in
A minor.</p>

<p>And now the anxious son found opportunity to hurry
with beating heart to Hamburg to see his father and to
make the acquaintance of his stepmother-elect. To find,
also, every probability that Jakob had chosen wisely, and
that his contemplated change of life bade fair to ensure a
happy and peaceful close to a career that had been full of
hardship and uncertainty.</p>

<p>Frau Caroline Schnack, a handsome widow who had
already been twice a wife, was just turned forty-one, and
therefore more than seventeen years the junior of her proposed
third husband. She had an only child, her son
Fritz, born of her second marriage, now a lad of about
thirteen. Capable and managing, she kept an excellent
public dining-room for single men not far from the musicians'
'B&ouml;rse,' described in an early chapter of our narrative,
and had a regular <i>client&egrave;le</i> amongst the members of the
Stadt Theater orchestra. Since the time when Johannes
had thought it advisable for his parents to separate, Jakob
had been one of her daily customers, and her good cooking
and substantial capacity had gradually opened for her the
way to his affection. Johannes, on his interview with Frau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Schnack, was at once favourably impressed by her personality
and gave his consent to the engagement, only
insisting that full time for consideration on both sides
should be allowed before the taking of the irrevocable step
of marriage; and after a day or two in Hamburg he set out
with a greatly relieved mind for Detmold, where he had
arranged with Bargheer to spend the Christmas week and to
reappear as composer and pianist on the scenes of his former
activity.</p>

<p>The visit passed off most happily. The great composer,
to whom, with some disappointment, much success and
fame had come since his last sojourn in the little capital six
years previously, was merry according to his wont when in
the midst of familiar associates. Such changes as had taken
place in the circle were for the better. Bargheer was
married, Carl von Meysenbug engaged. The reunions of
the former bachelor friends were enlivened by the presence
of ladies&mdash;charming young married women and pretty girls&mdash;and
Brahms was ready to abandon himself to any amount
of fun, his almost extravagant buoyancy of spirits being
no doubt assisted by the reaction from his late tension of
mind in regard to his father's affairs. These social occasions
were but the interludes between more serious pleasures.
Every day there was music at the palace, the castle, or
one or more of the private musical houses. Brahms conducted
his A major Serenade and played Beethoven's E flat
Concerto at an orchestral concert, and took part in a soir&eacute;e
at the palace, where, amongst other things, he performed
the Kreutzer Sonata with Bargheer before the well-remembered
sympathetic court circle. The visit, which was the
last paid by him to Detmold, formed a fitting close to his
association with Prince Leopold's court, to whose memory,
and especially to that of the various members of the princely
family, must ever attach the artistic distinction of their
early recognition of the composer's genius and their appreciation
of his personality.</p>

<p>Brahms' next destination was Oldenburg, where he
arrived in time to celebrate the New Year's festival of 1866<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
with the Dietrichs. He played his own Concerto and an
unpublished composition of Schubert at the subscription
concert of January 5, and at the chamber music soir&eacute;e of
the 10th contributed some Bach solos to the programme
and took part with Dietrich in a performance of Schumann's
Variations in B flat, and with Engel and Westermann in
the first public performance of his own Horn Trio, which
created a deep impression. It is important to add here
that Westermann used the natural horn on the occasion
by the particular desire of Brahms, who now and always
insisted to the hornists of his acquaintance on the impossibility
of securing a poetical interpretation of his work
with the ventil horn.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'If the performer is not obliged by the stopped notes to
play softly the piano and violin are not obliged to adapt
themselves to him, and the tone is rough from the beginning.'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The appearances at Oldenburg closed the <i>tourn&eacute;e</i>. Gratified
as our musician declared himself to be with the results of
his journey, which, if it had not brought him a series of
triumphs, had at least demonstrated the fact that his works
were gradually making their way through the musical circles
of Europe, it was not, as we know, part either of his inclination
or his aim to prolong his occasional artistic travels.
He chafed at the restriction to personal freedom resulting
from fixed engagements, and at the disturbance of mind
inseparable from hurried journeys from place to place,
and this year he had more than ordinary reason for desiring
to be settled again to the quiet concentration of thought
essential to all art-creation worthy to be so called. After
a second and longer stay in Hamburg that confirmed the
satisfaction with which he had lately contemplated the
idea of his father's approaching marriage, he returned to
Carlsruhe to pass the rest of the winter in Allgeyer's house
in Langenstrasse, now known as Kaiserstrasse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The first quarter of the year 1866 witnessed the publication
of a long list of works. By Rieter-Biedermann, the
two sets of extraordinarily difficult and brilliant Paganini
Variations for Pianoforte, which, when in the hands of a
competent executant, are found to be full of original and
striking effects, even if they be inferior in musical value to
the composer's other achievements in this form<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; the three
Sacred Choruses, Op. 37, for unaccompanied women's
voices, and mentioned in our first volume in connection
with the Ladies' Choir. By Simrock, the second String
Sextet in G major, worthy sister to its companion work,
though it has not obtained quite so wide a popularity,
and the Sonata in E minor, dedicated to Dr. Josef G&auml;nsbacher.
The Horn Trio was issued by the same house
quite at the end of the year.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The Sonata in E minor for pianoforte and violoncello, the
earliest of Brahms' seven published duet sonatas for pianoforte
and another instrument, all of which are characteristic
examples of certain sides of his genius, is a valuable number
in the comparatively short list of works of its class for the
violoncello. The first movement is of graceful, expressive,
delicately melodious character, rising at one point of the
development section towards passion, but returning immediately
to the dainty, dreaming mood by which the
composer so often subdues his hearers to the spell of his
imagination. The 'allegretto quasi menuetto' which follows
is an exquisite example of a species of movement in the
making of which Brahms stands unrivalled. It fascinates
with irresistible certainty by its ethereal, playful, poetic
fancy, to which the touch of seriousness in the trio offers
just sufficient, not too pronounced, contrast. The finale
is written <i>con amore</i> in the form of a free fugue, which, full
of spirit and energy throughout its course, rattles to its close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
in a lively coda. Care should be taken not to exaggerate
the pace of this movement in performance. If taken too
quickly, the violoncello passages lose their due effect.</p>

<p>On his return to Carlsruhe, Brahms settled down to the
actual writing of the German Requiem, with which he was
occupied during the succeeding months, and it was one of
Allgeyer's favourite recollections in later years that a
portion of the inspired work had been put on paper under
his roof.</p>

<p>It is well known that Brahms' nearest friends accepted
the composition as his memorial of his mother. 'We all
think he wrote it in her memory, though he has never
expressly said so,' Frau Schumann told the author some
years later. 'Never has a nobler monument been raised by
filial love,' said Joachim, referring to the German Requiem
in the course of his address at the Brahms Memorial Festival
held at Meiningen in October, 1899; and we may at least
say with certainty that the work, which must be regarded
as the crowning point of much of the composer's previous
activity, is, on the whole, a memorial of the emotions by
which he was stirred during the period that immediately
succeeded his mother's death, apart from the question of
whether or not he had planned it at an earlier time. It is,
however, a circumstance of great interest that the strains
he had conceived in his grief for the tragedy of Schumann's
illness recurred to him as appropriate for the solemn
mourning march&mdash;one of the most vivid and extraordinary
of his inspirations&mdash;of the Requiem,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and we cannot be
wrong in assuming that the remembrance of his beloved
friend was with him as he worked. Perhaps we may venture
to think that two of the strongest affections and griefs
of Brahms' life, associated with strangely contrasted objects&mdash;Schumann,
the great genius and master, Johanna, the
simple old mother&mdash;live together in this exalted music.
There is no warrant for the statement of anything more
precise as to the composer's intention excepting with regard
to the fifth number, the soprano solo with chorus, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
added some time after the completion of the other movements.
Of this it may be said definitely, as will presently
appear, that whilst Brahms was engaged in writing it the
thought of his mother was present in a special sense to his
memory.</p>

<p>Jakob's marriage with Frau Schnack took place in March,
rather more than a year after the death of his first wife.
Johannes sent a substantial sum of money as a wedding
present, and his great contentment in the anticipation of
his father's happiness was a constant and favourite theme
in his talks with Allgeyer, always an interested and sympathetic
listener.</p>

<p>Frau Caroline's business was given up, and the newly-married
pair settled into a comfortable flat on the fourth
floor of No. 5, Anscharplatz, at the corner of Valentin's
Camp, a respectable business quarter of Hamburg, where
there was sufficient accommodation to allow Frau Caroline
to turn her housekeeping talents to account by taking
two or three men boarders. A large airy room, 'the corner
room,' was reserved for Johannes, who was ultimately
responsible for the rent of the flat, and to it were transferred
his books, bookcase, and other belongings, from the apartments
that had been his mother's in the Lange Reihe,
whilst Elise arranged to live near an aunt in another quarter
of the city. A photograph of Johannes, taken by Allgeyer,
was sent to Jakob a few weeks after the wedding as a permanent
souvenir of his son's felicitations on the occasion.
It is still in existence, and is now in the possession of Herr
Fritz Schnack, 'the second Fritz,' as Johannes caressingly
called his quasi stepbrother.</p>

<p>Persuaded by Theodor Kirchner, who was at this time resident
in Z&uuml;rich, to spend the summer near him, Brahms,
arriving in the middle of April, found a lodging in a small
house on the Z&uuml;richberg which commanded a splendid
prospect of lake and mountain. Here every facility was
abundantly at hand for his enjoyment. Dividing his time,
from a very early hour of the morning until noon, between
musing in the open air and work in his room, he was usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to be met about twelve o'clock in the museum, which
became a place of rendezvous for his friends. After the
early dinner, always taken out of doors in fine weather, and
a more or less prolonged sitting over newspapers, or in chat
with acquaintance, in the open air, he would drop in at a
friend's house, generally Kirchner's, pass an hour or two in
informal sociability, and often make music with some of the
resident musicians. It was at Kirchner's that he became
acquainted with the celebrated Swiss writer and poet,
Gottfried Keller, and with the distinguished Z&uuml;rich professor
of surgery, Dr. Theodor Billroth, who was some four years
our composer's senior, and who, called subsequently to
Vienna, became one of Brahms' most familiar friends.
Billroth's love for music was second only to his devotion to
his own great vocation. He had studied the violin under
Eschmann, played at a weekly trio meeting at his house in
Plattenstrasse, Z&uuml;rich, and was sufficiently proficient to
take part on the viola with professional musicians in private
performances of Beethoven's quartets and Brahms' sextets.
He could play the piano well, was a good sight-reader, and
acted occasionally as musical critic to one of the Z&uuml;rich
papers.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms arrived here a few days ago,' he writes on the 22nd
of April to his friend, Professor L&uuml;bke of Stuttgart. 'This
morning he and Kirchner played some of Liszt's symphonic
poems on two pianofortes. Horrible music!... We purged
ourselves with Brahms' new sextet that has just come out.
Brahms and Kirchner played it as a duet.'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The composer became intimate, also, at the house of Herr
and Frau Wesendonck, who had been Wagner's great friends
during his residence at Z&uuml;rich, and could not hear enough
about the composer of the 'Meistersinger,' of whom the
Wesendoncks possessed inexhaustible personal recollections
and several valuable souvenirs. Amongst these was the
master's autograph score of the 'Rheingold,' an object that
was regarded by Brahms with a respect almost amounting
to veneration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Traits of habit and character similar to those with which
the reader is familiar, and which recall the period of the
Detmold visits, are described in Steiner's 'Recollections,' by
Capellmeister F. Hegar,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> who was the inseparable associate
of Brahms and Kirchner:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... We were no less impressed by his extraordinarily sound
health. He could venture upon anything. How often has
he passed the night on the sofa of my bachelor's quarters
when he was disinclined to climb the Z&uuml;richberg in the late
hours of evening. Once indeed, when an older friend less
hardy than himself claimed my hospitality, he lay down
underneath my grand piano, and declared next morning that
he had slept splendidly.'</p>

<p>Hegar mentions that Brahms' musical memory and
unusually rapid power of apprehension excited the astonished
admiration of the Z&uuml;rich musicians.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'When we played him our compositions for the first time,
he would afterwards sit down and repeat long portions
note for note from memory, pointing out the weak places.'</p>

<p>One or two reminiscences of the summer are to be found
in the volume of Billroth's letters from which quotation has
already been made. Amongst them is the description of a
music-party at his house, at which Brahms was present to
hear a performance of his lately-published Sextet in G major.
The consciousness of the composer's presence so unnerved
Billroth that he was obliged to ask Eschmann, who was
amongst the listeners, to relieve him of his part of second
viola.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I have learnt never to play before a composer,' he wrote
a few days afterwards, 'unless his work has been well
rehearsed. As I was quite familiar with the composition,
I could imagine the vexation Brahms must have felt,
although he put the matter aside in the kindest way.
Kirchner, Brahms and Hegar had been up late together the
night before and were tired. Everything contributed to
make the evening dull.'</p>

<p>Of the sextet he says: 'I think it wonderfully fine; so
clear, so simple, so masterly.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Brahms remained in Switzerland until the middle of
August, and, arriving on the 17th of this month to stay for
a few weeks at his old lodgings in Lichtenthal, surprised
Frau Schumann by appearing before her for the first time
with a beard. He did not at this period persevere very long
in wearing the appendage, which changed his appearance in
an unusual degree, but he adopted it a second time, and, as
it proved, permanently, about fourteen years later.</p>

<p>The composer had worked steadily on at the German
Requiem during the months of his residence in Z&uuml;rich,
and that he now completed it in Lichtenthal&mdash;save and
excepting only the fifth number&mdash;is to be inferred from the
inscription on the manuscript score&mdash;'Baden-Baden im
Sommer, 1866'&mdash;now in possession of the Gesellschaft der
Musikfreunde at Vienna. Great additional interest is given
to this date by a short entry made by Frau Schumann in
her diary early in September, which is, without doubt, the
earliest written note upon the now famous work.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Johannes has been playing me some magnificent movements
out of a Requiem of his own and a string quartet in
C minor. The Requiem delighted me even more, however.
It is full of tender and again daring thoughts. I
cannot feel clear as to how it will sound, but in myself it
sounds glorious.'<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The extract has a double interest, as furnishing a new
illustration of Brahms' caution with regard to publication,
and especially in the case of works which constituted for him
a new artistic departure. The String Quartet in C minor was
not published until 1873, seven years from our present date.</p>

<p>About the middle of September Joachim appeared in
Lichtenthal, and after a few days' stay there carried Brahms
away with him. He had become a man at large through the
political events of the year, by which the kingdom of
Hanover became part of Prussia, having felt it impossible to
accept the offer made him to retain his appointment after
the deposition of King George, and was able to follow his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
inclination as to his arrangements for the autumn and winter
season. These included tours in Switzerland and France, and
it was ultimately arranged between the friends that Johannes
should combine with him in some of his Swiss concerts.</p>

<p>Brahms spent most of the intervening time in Hamburg,
and was so happy in his comfortable corner room in the
Anscharplatz that he began seriously to entertain the idea
of settling down again under his father's roof. Frau Caroline
managed the household with careful but judicious thrift,
and there was peace and contentment in the home. In his
own way Jakob was as regular in his habits as his son.
Every morning he went to the 'B&ouml;rse' to inquire for work,
and was generally successful in obtaining small engagements,
often to act as substitute in the theatre orchestras. His
position as bassist at the Stadt Theater had come to an end
in the course of the fifties, owing to changes in the management,
but he continued a member of the Philharmonic
orchestra until a year before his death. He was proud and
fond of Frau Caroline, always came home as soon as his work
was done to enjoy the good plain fare which she had ready
for him, and was perfectly happy as he sat in the kitchen with
his pipe and a large cup of thin coffee, watching her movements.
Once a week he amused himself by walking in the
Jews' quarter of the city and inspecting the cheap second-hand
wares with which the vendors sought to tempt his
custom. His weakness for bargains was sometimes a source
of embarrassment to his wife, in spite of her firmness in
limiting his loose pocket-money to the sum of a few pence.
Now he would send home to her a quantity of wardrobe
hooks, another time many pounds'-weight of honey.
'Goodness, Brahms! what are we to do with it?' she
would despairingly inquire. 'Yes, Lina, but I couldn't let
it stand at the price,' he would answer. Johannes used to
lecture his father on his weakness for spending money,
telling him how careful he himself was obliged to be, and
could be seriously vexed if he found that Jakob had been
really extravagant or thoughtless. This, however, occurred
but seldom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>A letter to Dietrich from the Anscharplatz mentions the
Requiem, and evidently answers an inquiry from Albert
as to the long-delayed Symphony in C minor of which we
heard in the summer of 1862.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Dietrich!</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'Before the summer is over you shall be reminded of
me by a short greeting....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Unfortunately I cannot wait upon you with a symphony,
but it would be a joy to have you here for a day, to play you
my so-called German Requiem.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I have been till now living in Switzerland, in Z&uuml;rich.
I shall stay here a little and think of going then to
Vienna....'<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The concert-journey with Joachim was very successful,
and afforded Brahms quite unexpected evidence of the
progress his music was making in Switzerland. This country
was, in fact, one of the earliest in which his art met with
general appreciation, and much of the credit of its acceptance
there must be ascribed to the efforts of Theodor Kirchner,
who, as the reader may remember, was one of the most gifted
musicians of the Schumann circle, and who seized every
opportunity that offered from the beginning of Brahms'
career, to spread the understanding of his compositions.
Kirchner filled an organist's post at Winterthur for nearly
ten years before his removal to Z&uuml;rich in 1862, and, whilst
developing an active musical life in the little town, made his
influence felt far beyond its limits.</p>

<p>The tour opened on October 24 in Schaffhausen, and
included Winterthur, Basle, and finally M&uuml;hlhausen in
Alsace. An interesting incident of the visit to M&uuml;hlhausen
was the renewal of friendly relations, after ten years of
estrangement, between Joachim and von B&uuml;low, who was
resident during the season 1866-67 at Basle, and gave Trio
concerts there with Abel and Kahnt. No communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
took place between the former Weimar intimates during
the week passed by Brahms and Joachim at Basle, but
B&uuml;low's affectionate nature was strongly stirred by seeing
his old friend again on the concert-platform and hearing his
public performances, which he describes as 'ideal perfection.'
The sequel may be told in the words of his letter to
Raff, dated Basle, November 22.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'And now, a great piece of news. On Sunday the 10th
I travelled to M&uuml;hlhausen for the Brahms-Joachim concert,
and the relation of friendship between Joachim and me was
renewed on French soil after ten years' interruption. This
will lead to no results of a positive nature, but a stone has
been taken from my heart, and from his also as he has
assured your sister-in-law. For my sake Joachim returned
to Basle for a few hours and then took the night train to
Paris.'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Some years were yet to elapse before B&uuml;low could pretend
to any cordiality of feeling towards the art of Brahms. In
another letter of 1866 we read:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I respect and admire him, but&mdash;at a distance. The
Pianoforte Quintet seems to me the most interesting of his
large compositions.... Kiel is much more sympathetic
to me.'<a name="FNanchor_21a_21a" id="FNanchor_21a_21a"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>He prevailed upon himself, indeed, to play the Horn Trio
at his Basle Trio concert of March 26, 1867, when his
colleagues were Abel and Hans Richter, who commenced his
artist's career as a hornist, and was at this time living in
Switzerland in the enjoyment of Wagner's intimacy; and
he included Joachim's Variations for viola and pianoforte
in the same programme; but as late as 1870 he wrote to
Raff:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'What do the Br.'s matter to me? Brahms, Brahm&uuml;ller,
Bruch, etc. Don't mention them again! Who knows
whether a Riehl may not turn up in 1950 to beplutarch
them as maestrinelli? The only one who interests me is
Braff!'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that von B&uuml;low's critical faculty was subject
to the disturbing influence of his capacity for warm friendship
cannot lessen the admiration inspired by his talents
and his generous nature. His severe animadversions on
Brahms' works, together with his practical neglect of them
up to a period when his opinion as to their merits had
become very much a matter of indifference, may be pardoned
by the lovers of our master's art, who remember that they
were, for the most part, the outcome of his deep personal
affection for Liszt, Wagner, and Joachim, and of his long-continued
intimate association with the leaders and prominent
disciples of the New-German school.</p>

<p>Brahms returned to Vienna, after about a year and a half
of absence, immediately after his friend's departure from
M&uuml;hlhausen, and spent the winter quietly at work in his
room on the fourth story of No. 6, Poststrasse. The earliest
event of any importance to his career that marks the opening
months of the year 1867 is the first public performance of
the Sextet in G major, which was given at the Hellmesberger
concert of February 3. The reader will by this time hardly
be surprised to learn that the work was received without
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The composer was certainly called for and applauded,'
says Schelle, Hanslick's successor in the <i>Presse</i>, and a loyal
though unbiassed supporter of Brahms, 'but it was with a
certain reserve. One felt distinctly that the public was not
carried away by the work, but desired to do justice to so
admirable an achievement.... Brahms may be called a
virtuoso in the modern development of the quartet style,
... but only that can reach the heart which proceeds from
the heart, and the sextet comes from the hand and the head,
whilst the warm pulsations of the heart are to be felt only at
intervals.'</p>

<p>So Bach's works were once spoken of, so Beethoven's in
their day. So, it may almost be said, must be criticised all
musical creative achievement that adequately expresses an
original individuality. The composer of genius has to go
through a long apprenticeship before he acquires a language
of his own really capable of conveying his thoughts to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
world. By the time he is master of it, he has, by the nature
of things, placed himself outside the immediate comprehension
of all but a few specially qualified listeners, and must
be willing to wait for his reward until some of those to whom
he speaks have had time to follow him a certain distance
along his appointed path, and opportunity to become
familiarized with his manner of utterance. Brahms was
content to wait, and he waited almost with equanimity of
spirit, never losing faith in the future, though he had something
more pronounced to encounter than indifference.
Hirsch, of the <i>Wiener Zeitung</i>, wrote apropos of the sextet:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'We are always seized with a kind of oppression when
the new John in the wilderness, Herr Johannes Brahms,
announces himself. This prophet, proclaimed by Robert
Schumann in his darkening hours, who, for the rest, has his
energetic admirers in Vienna&mdash;we mention this in our
position, from pure love of truth&mdash;makes us quite disconsolate
with his impalpable, dizzy tone-vexations that have neither
body nor soul and can only be products of the most
desperate effort. Such manifest, glaring, artificiality is quite
peculiar to this gentleman. How many drops of perspiration
may adhere to these note-heads?'</p>

<p>On the 25th of this same month of February, the earlier
B flat Sextet, by this time almost popular in more than one
Continental city, and long known in New York through
Mason's concerts, was performed for the first time in England
at the Monday Popular Concerts, St. James's Hall, London,
by Joachim, Louis Ries, Henry Blagrove, Zerbini, Paque,
and Piatti. The director, S. Arthur Chappell, printed a
notice in the programme-books to the effect that he introduced
the work by Joachim's desire. It made no impression,
and the composer was not again heard at the Popular
Concerts for five years.</p>

<p>If the recognition of Brahms' exact claims as a composer,
even by his Austrian public, long remained dubious, his
qualities as a pianist seldom failed to evoke unmistakable
signs of their warm approval. With the arrival of March
he prevailed upon himself this year to announce concerts in
Vienna, Graz, Klagenfurth, and Pesth, and the success of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
his performances was unequivocal, in spite of the approach
of spring and the unusual warmth of the season.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'At last a pianist who entirely takes hold of one,' exclaims
Schelle, writing of the first concert; 'one only needs to
hear his first few chords to be convinced that Herr Brahms
is a player of quite extraordinary stamp. The musical critic
of the <i>Wiener Zeitung</i> writes that Herr Brahms was cordially
received by his "party." We may remark that Brahms
was received, not by a "party," but by the entire very
numerous public, with applause such as is seldom heard in
Vienna concert-rooms. If, however, the audience of the
evening is to be described as the "party" of the distinguished
artist, it must be said that his party consists of the
cultivated experts of musical Vienna.'</p>

<p>The instrumental numbers of the programme were
Beethoven's Fantasia, Op. 77; Bach's G major Fantasia;
Brahms' Scherzo; Schumann's Etudes Symphoniques;
Brahms' Paganini Variations. The concert-giver played as
an additional piece his own arrangement for the pianoforte
of the fugue from Beethoven's String Quartet, Op. 59,
No. 3,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'which,' says Schelle, 'claims almost more admiration even
than his performance, for it is a most faithful reflection of
the entire score which we meet unchanged in the effective
costume.'</p>

<p>At the second concert in Vienna, which took place on
April 7, after Brahms' return from the provinces, the programme
included Bach's F major Toccata; Beethoven's
Sonata, Op. 109; Brahms' Handel Variations and Fugue;
Schumann's Fantasia in C, Op. 17; and short pieces by
Scarlatti and Schubert. As an additional piece, an arrangement
of a movement from Schubert's Octet was conceded.
Vocal numbers were included in both programmes.</p>

<p>Brahms himself mentions the concerts in a letter to
Dietrich.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The result was so good in every respect,' he writes, 'that
I must call myself doubly an ass for not having secured
it earlier and taken the opportunity to get rid of my
Requiem.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>He let the work lie for several months longer, however,
without coming to any decision about it. On July 30 he
again wrote to Dietrich:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... In all haste: I start to-morrow with my father
on a little tour through Upper Austria. I do not know
when I shall be back. Keep the accompanying Requiem
until I write to you. Don't let it go out of your hands
and write to me very seriously by-and-by what you think
of it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'An <i>offer</i> from Bremen would be very acceptable to me.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It would have to be combined with a concert engagement.
In short <i>Reinthaler</i> must probably be sufficiently pleased
with the thing to do something for it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'For the rest, I am inclined to let such matters quietly
alone, for I do not intend to worry myself about them.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I am ready for anything from Christmas onwards.
Joachim and I probably gave concerts here before.'</p>

<p>There is a trace of nervous anxiety in this letter which
leaves little doubt that Brahms had within him the consciousness
that in the German Requiem he had transcended
all his previous achievements, and that he was even unusually
anxious to ensure a favourable opportunity for the
hearing of his new work. Until now it had been submitted
to none of his companions, save, perhaps, Joachim,
and it is evident that he did not easily bring himself to the
resolution of sending it away even for Dietrich's sympathetic
inspection, and that, whilst he hoped, he somewhat dreaded
to hear the result of a communication with Reinthaler. We
must postpone for awhile our account of the fortunes of the
manuscript in order to follow our musician on his holiday
journey, on which he no doubt started with a mind sufficiently
relieved by the mere fact of his decision to be able to
await with composure the next issues of fate.</p>

<p>Herr k&ouml;niglich Musikdirektor Carl Martin Reinthaler
(born 1822), municipal music-director of Bremen and
organist of the cathedral, to whom the manuscript is meanwhile
to be submitted, was a distinguished musician and
the composer of numerous works in very varied forms,
vocal and instrumental. His oratorio 'Jepthah' was performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
in London in 1856 under John Hullah's direction;
several of his operas&mdash;'K&auml;thchen von Heilbronn,' 'Edda,'
etc.&mdash;composed later in his career, were given with success
in Bremen, Hanover, and other towns; and his 'Bismarck
Hymn' won the prize in a competition adjudged at Dortmund.
By his talent and earnestness in his position as
conductor of the orchestral concerts at Bremen, he did much
to raise the standard of musical taste in the city.</p>

<p>Our composer's invitation to his father to accompany him
on a tour amongst the Austrian Alps had mightily gratified
Jakob. The violinist, young Carl Bade, happening to call at
the Anscharplatz on the day of his start for Vienna, found
him carefully dressed for the journey, and in a high state
of elation and delight. Wrapping himself in an air of
mysterious mock dignity, he scarcely vouchsafed a word of
greeting to his wondering young friend, but, drawing himself
up to his full height, gravely adjusted his necktie and
paced the room in silence. Then, coming to a standstill,
he pursed up his lips and looked at Bade with an expression
of sly significance. 'Min Hannes het mi inladt; ick reis mit
min Hannes' (My Hannes has invited me; I travel with
my Hannes), he said in answer to Bade's demands for an
explanation. A glimpse of him on his arrival is afforded by
the recollection of Dr. Josef G&auml;nsbacher, who was to accompany
father and son on their journey, and, calling to make
last arrangements with Johannes, found Jakob with him.
The manuscript of the beautiful song 'Mainacht,' which had
that day been composed, was at hand, and at his friend's
request G&auml;nsbacher sang it then and there, and added the
lovely 'Wie bist du meine K&ouml;nigin' for the benefit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
elder Brahms, who expressed himself, as in duty bound,
pleased with the songs, and was undoubtedly gratified by
the compliment paid him.</p>

<p>The route chosen by the travellers lay through Styria and
Carinthia, regions abounding in grand and romantic scenery
of mountain, lake and forest; but though Johannes, an
inveterate optimist in many ways, talked afterwards of his
father's enjoyment of the journey, it is to be feared that
Jakob, who had scarcely quitted Hamburg since his arrival
there as a youth of nineteen, did not develop any great
appreciation of the beauties of nature. He managed the
ascent of the Hochschwab, or part of it, on foot, but it was
a great deal too much for him. He was too old and too
heavy to begin an apprenticeship as a mountaineer, and on
the next expedition of the kind made by Johannes and
G&auml;nsbacher he remained behind at the village of Wildalpen.
He got on much better when walking on the even, but
wisely made no attempt to emulate the indefatigable
pedestrian powers of his son, who would frequently stride
on until he was an hour ahead of his companions. Jakob
was better able to appreciate those parts of the journey
which were accomplished by carriage or boat, though even
there he spoke but little, perhaps hardly knowing how to
express himself. One day, however, when the three
travellers were on the Grundlsee, one of the most secluded
and romantic of the Austrian lakes, he stood up and looked
slowly round him, as if impressed by the beauty of the scene.
'Just like the Alster at home in Hamburg,' he remarked at
length, as he sat down again.</p>

<p>Johannes fell in with some parties of his Austrian friends
during the expedition, and was plainly gratified by the consideration
shown to his father by one and all. One enthusiastic
lady went so far as to bestow a kiss on the old man&mdash;an
attention which procured him some good-natured raillery
from his son, and which he discreetly left unmentioned for
some time after his return to the Anscharplatz. He went
back by way of Heidelberg, stopping to see the castle and
other attractions by the desire of Johannes, and, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
while after reaching home, received from Vienna a souvenir
of the doubtful pleasures of his journey in the shape of some
mountain charts of the districts through which he had
travelled, with blue lines drawn to mark the summits he
had been able to attain by mountain railways or other
mechanical means of transit. The maps, carefully preserved
by Jakob, remain as a memorial of the composer's loving
thought of his father, whom he indulged and spoilt almost
like a petted child at this period of his life.</p>

<p>The journey over, Brahms' thoughts reverted to the
manuscript which he had confided to Dietrich's care, and
as soon as he was back in Vienna he wrote to beg for its
return:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Albert</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Please send my score back to me as soon as possible
and turn the opportunity to good account by enclosing this
and that&mdash;above all a long letter.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I had the great pleasure of having my father with me for
some weeks. We made a pleasant tour through Styria and
Salzburg. Imagine what enjoyment my father's pleasure
gave me, he had never seen a mountain....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Now I think of remaining here quietly; it is unfortunately
useless for me to make plans, for only that happens
which comes of itself.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Nevertheless I wish to have the Requiem in my own
cupboard again, so send....'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>To this note Dietrich returned no answer, and Brahms,
becoming impatient, applied for information as to the
whereabouts of his work to Joachim, who wrote back that
it was in Reinthaler's keeping. Possibly Brahms may have
been a little startled at finding that Dietrich, in his eager
friendship, had put such an elastic interpretation upon the
mention of the Bremen director quoted in our last chapter
as to pass over the injunction not to part with the manuscript;
but however this may be, he cannot but have been
gratified at finding, as the result, that the musician of his own
selection had been so impressed by the work as to wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
produce it at the earliest appropriate opportunity in the
cathedral of Bremen. It is known to some of Reinthaler's
old friends that he suggested the enlargement of the work to
the dimensions of an oratorio. That Brahms did not entertain
the proposal is matter of history.</p>

<p>The first performance of the Requiem, as originally completed,
to be given under Brahms' direction in Bremen
Cathedral, was fixed for Good Friday, April 10, 1868. Meanwhile
the composer's engagements kept him in Austria. The
first three numbers of the new work were to be produced under
Herbeck at the Gesellschaft concert of December 1, and a
tour arranged with Joachim for the ante-Christmas concert-season
included concerts in Vienna, Budapest, and various
provincial towns. The journey, which opened at Vienna
on November 9, was triumphantly successful. Joachim
performed the great solos of his r&eacute;pertoire by Bach, Tartini,
and Spohr, and shorter pieces by Schumann and Paganini,
with all of which concert-goers are now familiar, appearing
also on his own account in several great orchestral concerts.
Brahms played works by Bach, Schumann, Schubert, and
some of his own compositions. Together the concert-givers
were heard in several of Beethoven's duet Sonatas, Schubert's
Fantasia, Op. 159, and Rondo Brilliant, Op. 70, etc.</p>

<p>'When Brahms and Joachim play Beethoven, Bach,
Schubert together, the conceptions are like living tone
pictures,' says Billroth, who, called to Vienna about a year
after his first acquaintance with Brahms at Z&uuml;rich and settled
there for good, had the delight of receiving and hearing his
two great artist friends at his house several times during
the two months of Joachim's stay.</p>

<p>The Gesellschaft concert of December 1 was devoted to the
memory of Schubert, and the three first numbers of the
German Requiem formed an appropriate first portion of
a programme of which the second half consisted of a selection
from Schubert's music to 'Rosamund,' given for the first time
in a concert-room. The choruses were, of course, sung by
the Singverein, and Dr. P&auml;nzer, of the imperial chapel, was
responsible for the baritone solo of the Requiem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The performance of Brahms' movements did not result
in a success, though the two first were received with some
tokens of approval. At the conclusion of the third an
extraordinary scene took place. The now celebrated pedal
point,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> on which the last section of this number is constructed,
produced&mdash;partly owing to a mistake of the
drummer, who drowned the chorus by playing the famous
'D' <i>forte</i> throughout&mdash;a condition of nervous tension in a
portion of the audience, a longing to be relieved from the
monotony of the one dominating sound; and when the
composer appeared on the platform in answer to the calls
of some of his hearers, unmistakable demonstrations of
hostility mingled with the plaudits. It may, indeed, be
confidently surmised, and cannot appear surprising, that but
few even of those who supported him on this occasion had
any clear conception either of the meaning or importance of
his work. To Hanslick it appeared</p>

<p class="blockquot">'one of the ripest fruits in the domain of sacred music,
developed out of the style of Beethoven's late works....
The harmonic and contrapuntal art learnt by Brahms in
the school of Bach, and inspired by him with the living breath
of the present, is almost forgotten in the expression of touching
lament, increasing to the annihilating death-shudder.'</p>

<p>Of its reception he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It is intelligible that a composition so difficult to understand,
and which deals only with ideas of death, is not
adapted for popular success and that it does not entirely
answer to the demands of a great public. We should have
supposed, however, that a presentiment of the greatness
and seriousness of the work would have suggested itself
even to those who do not like it and would have won their
respect. This seems not to have been the case with half a
dozen gray-haired fanatics of the old school, who had the
rudeness to greet the applauding majority and the composer,
as he appeared, with prolonged hissing&mdash;a requiem on
the decorum and good manners of a Vienna concert-room
which astonishes and grieves us.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Schelle, after reviewing the first number sympathetically
and the second almost enthusiastically, continues:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Unfortunately the third is extremely inferior to it
[No. 2]; the text demanded a strong increase of effect
which the composer has been incapable of giving. The bass
solo is not written gratefully for the voice and there is much
that is obtrusively bizarre and unedifying in the chorus....
The movement was a failure....'</p>

<p>Hirsch did not fail to make use of his opportunity in the
<i>Wiener Zeitung</i>. He speaks of the 'heathenish noise of the
kettledrums,' and declares 'in the interest of truth' that
the opposition party in the audience had an immense
majority.'</p>

<p>The concert is mentioned by Billroth in a letter dated
December 24:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I like Brahms better every time I meet him. Hanslick
says, quite rightly, that he has the same fault as Bach and
Beethoven; he has too little of the sensuous in his art both
as composer and pianist. I think it is rather an intentional
avoidance of everything sensuous as of a fault. His
Requiem is so nobly spiritual and so Protestant-Bachish
that it was difficult to make it go down here. The hissing
and clapping became really violent; it was a party conflict.
In the end the applause conquered.'</p>

<p>It is characteristic of Brahms that his belief in the future
of his work was not diminished by the untoward incidents
of this occasion. He looked forward to the result of the
coming performance in Bremen with a confidence that was
even enhanced by the fact that he had gained experience
with respect to the instrumentation of the third chorus.</p>

<p>He sent part of his manuscript to Marxsen with a letter
from which the following quotation was first published by
Sittard in his 'Studien und Charakteristiken':</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I send you some novelties and beg you, if time allows,
to write me <i>one</i> or <i>many</i> words about them. I enclose also
something from my Requiem and <i>on this I earnestly beg
you to write to me</i>. It looks rather curious in places and
perhaps, in order to spare my manuscript, you would take
some music paper and put down useful remarks. <i>I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>like that very much.</i> The eternal "D" in No. 3. If I do
not use the organ it does not sound. There is much I
should like to ask. I hope you have time and some inclination;
then you will perceive at once what there is to ask
and what to say.'</p>

<p>It is, as Hanslick observed, by no means unintelligible
that the first part of the German Requiem was not immediately
accepted by the general body of listeners assembled
at the Gesellschaft concert of December 1, unprepared as
they were for the new and important element underlying its
conception. The title chosen by the composer was at the time,
and has been occasionally since, demurred to as misleading,
on account of the long association of the term
Requiem with the ritual of the Roman Church. It
should, however, be obvious that by the word 'German'
departure is indicated from the practice of previous composers,
which places the composition in a category of its own
and gives to its message an applicableness beyond the limitations
of creed. Brahms arranged his own words, and by the
fact of doing so, by his inspired musical treatment of his
texts, and his direct avoidance of giving to his work an
association with a particular church service or a familiar
musical form, requiem or mass, cantata or oratorio, has
preserved in it, whether or not consciously, an element of
personal fervour that constitutes part of the secret of its
spell.</p>

<p>The texts, culled from various books of the Old and New
Testaments and the Apocrypha,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> have been chosen, with
entire absence of so-called doctrinal purpose, as parts of the
people's book, of Luther's Bible, the accepted representative
to Protestant nations of the highest aspirations of man, and
have been so arranged as to present in succession the
ascending ideas of sorrow consoled, doubt overcome, death
vanquished. That they open and close with the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
love is not of necessity to be ascribed solely to the artistic
requirements of the work, or the exigencies of its sacred
theme. Whoever has studied Brahms' life and works with
sympathetic insight will be aware that the suggestion of love
triumphant runs through both like a continuous silver
thread, and it is open to those who choose, to accept this as
indicative of a faith dwelling within him, which was none the
less fruitful for good because it knew nothing of the dogma
of the Churches.</p>

<p>The opening chorus of the Requiem furnishes the key-note
of its spirit:</p>

<p>'<i>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
doubtless come again with joy, bearing his sheaves with him.
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</i>'</p>

<p>What more reassuring prelude could prepare the human
soul for encounter with its most dreaded foe than these
inspired words, heard in the exquisite setting of consolation
by which the composer has illumined their meaning? The
tenderness of the benediction, the passion of the anticipation,
the recurring mournful calm that dies away in the softest
whisper of comfort, place the mind in an attitude of awed
suspense which finds its solution in the opening bars of the
solemn, mysterious march of the second movement. Here
we are surely in the majestic presence of death incarnate,
wrapped, however, in a haze of beauty, sorrow, tenderness,
compassion, that betoken, not the ruthless enemy of mankind,
but a deeply mournful messenger subdued to a Divine
purpose. '<i>Behold, all flesh is as grass, and all the glory
of man as the flower of grass</i>,' chant the altos and tenors in
unison an octave above the basses, something of unearthliness
in their tones, with the alternate repetitions of the
march; and the delicate, evanescent harmonies of the answering
phrase, '<i>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth</i>,' strangely
deepen the impression of transitoriness conveyed by the
text. Relief is given by a middle episode of somewhat more
animated character: '<i>Be patient therefore, brethren, unto
the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the precious fruit of the earth, and hath, long patience for it
until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient.</i>'
The final ending of the march, which is repeated after the
episode, is succeeded by the outburst of a transitional
passage&mdash;'<i>God's word endureth for ever</i>'&mdash;leading to the
vigorous gladness of the second section of the movement
(fugato)&mdash;'<i>And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come
to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they
shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away</i>'&mdash;whose ringing, jubilant tones are checked only by
the passing shade of sorrow, until it subsides into the more
tranquilly happy mood in which the chorus terminates.</p>

<p>In the third number the vision alters. To exaltation
succeeds abasement. We are shown the despondency, that
is almost despair, of the soul prostrate before its Lord:
'<i>Lord, make me to know mine end, and the number of my days
what it is, that I may know how frail I am</i>.' The movement
opens with a baritone solo, supported by basses, drums, and
horn, which seems to crave nothing, hope for nothing.
Words and melody are, however, immediately repeated in
chorus with plain harmonies that somewhat relieve the first
impressive gloom. Then there is a change. The final
cadence of the solo<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> becomes, in the chorus, a surprise
cadence upon which the baritone re-enters: '<i>Behold, thou
hast made my days as an handbreadth, and mine age is as
nothing before thee</i>.' The tension relaxes, and a note of
pleading makes itself felt that is strengthened in the choral
repetition of the phrase by the movement of the accompanying
instruments. Through despondency, through resignation,
through questioning, the soul gradually rises to hope:
'<i>Verily man at his best state is altogether vanity. Surely
every man walketh in a vain show, surely they are disquieted
in vain; he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall
gather them. Now, Lord, what do I wait for?</i>' The pleading
becomes importunity, and the crisis is reached with the
reiteration of the last words, first in an increasing agitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and finally in deliberate, hushed tones that seem to challenge
the Lord. The effect that follows is, perhaps, unsurpassed in
its pure loveliness throughout the domain of sacred music.
With the passage '<i>My hope is in thee</i>' all doubt is resolved
in a glow of warmth, reconciliation, and trust, and the
perfect assurance of faith, '<i>The souls of the righteous are
in God's hand</i>' becomes the subject of an accompanied
choral fugue, constructed from beginning to end upon a
tonic pedal point, which establishes the brief inspiration of
the transition passage in a protracted expression of unshakable
confidence, and forms, not only the climax of the
movement, but the first climax of the entire work. In it
the soul attains to an elevation of faith from which it does
not again falter. Though sorrow may not yet be finally
subdued, doubt is conquered, and the fourth number&mdash;'<i>How
amiable are thy dwellings, O Lord of Hosts! My soul longeth,
yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my
flesh crieth out for the living God. Blessed are they that dwell
in thy house; they will be still praising thee</i>'&mdash;is a clear,
melodious choral song with a flowing accompaniment,
harmonized simply, and with an occasional point of imitation,
that expresses simple affection and trust, emphasized
towards the close of the movement by the employment of
increased contrapuntal resource.</p>

<p>The fifth number, added, as we have said, after the work
was first finished, and not essential to its conception as a
whole, may have been conceded to some need of contrast
felt by the composer on hearing the completed six movements
consecutively. It consists of a very beautiful soprano solo
with chorus, of rather mystic character, to the words
'<i>And ye now are sorrowful. As one whom his mother comforteth,
so will I comfort you.</i>'</p>

<p>The sixth chorus opens with a dirge&mdash;'<i>For we have no
abiding city, but we seek one to come</i>'&mdash;soon to be interrupted
by the baritone solo: '<i>Behold, I shew you a mystery: we shall
not all sleep, but we shall be changed.</i>' The words are repeated
by the chorus with a heightening agitation of mysterious
expectancy, that leaps suddenly at the clarion call to tumultuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
exultation: '<i>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
at the trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</i>' The wild
agitation is stayed by the quiet message of the solo, '<i>Then
shall be brought to pass the saying that is written</i>,' and a prolonged
half-cadence leads to the re-entry of the chorus
in a magnificently-sustained inspiration of triumphant joy:
'<i>Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy
sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</i>' The glorious movement,
after mounting from height to height of power and
splendour, suddenly, with an unexpected change of time and
key, reaches its climax in a brilliant fugue, that seems, with
its passion of never-ending praise, to reopen the door of
heaven and to transport the soul of the hearer to the
dazzling scene of the throne that is filled with the ineffable
presence of God: '<i>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive honour
and power, for thou hast created all things, and for thy good
pleasure they are and were created.</i>'</p>

<p>The great work has now reached its final climax. The
imagination of the modern seer, soaring beyond sorrow,
doubt, death, has pierced for a moment through the mystery
of things and shown us the unspeakable. But the vision is
not yet at an end. As in the writing of the Revelation of
St. John, so in the inspired music of the German Requiem.
After the lightnings and thunders and all the manifold glory
of the throne, the voice of the spirit: '<i>Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit, that
they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow
them.</i>' Confident, tender, majestic, the message floats
through the seventh movement, a veritable requiem, a
true song of peace, and, heard at length in the tones of the
benediction with which the work opens, sinks into silence
with reiteration of blessing.</p>

<p>It would be an attractive task to analyze the technical
means that Brahms has employed to give musical expression
to the varied ideas, all rooted in the central one of overruling
love, which together form the subject of this exalted work.
Whilst he has used the resources of classical art with a power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and ease that recall the mastery of Bach and Handel, he has
given warmth and life to his creation by availing himself of
the harmonic development of musical means to which the
genius of Schumann gave such strong stimulus. Wisely
conservative, he was also modern in the best sense, nor
could the German Requiem have attained the position it
has won in the hearts of thousands of men and women to
whom it has brought comfort in bereavement or solace in
times of mental distress, if he had not understood and shared
in the spirit, and answered to it in an idiom, proper to his
time. This should not be forgotten in the performance of
the great work, which is sometimes given with a cold, formal
correctness supposed to be appropriate in the case of classical
compositions. Brahms was not a pedant, but a poet and
idealist, and the full beauty and fascination of his music is
disclosed only when it is interpreted with the insight that is
born of enthusiasm and imagination.</p>

<p>The Horn Trio was played in Vienna at the Hellmesberger
Quartet concert of December 29 by Brahms, Hellmesberger,
and Kleinecke. Kleinecke performed on the natural horn,
and the beauty of his tone was remarked on by one or two
of the critics. The trio was received not unfavourably,
but with the reserve that usually attended the early performances
of the composer's works in the imperial capital at
this period of his career.</p>

<p>The publications of the year were but two in number&mdash;the
set of sixteen Waltzes for four hands on the Piano, dedicated
to Hanslick; and a book of five Songs for men's four-part
Chorus, both issued in the spring by Rieter-Biedermann.
Several, at least, of the waltzes date from the Detmold
period, and were played by Brahms, and heard by Carl von
Meysenbug, at the H&ocirc;tel Stadt Frankfurt. They are inimitable
in their delicate, caressing grace, and possess a charm
which perhaps exceeds that of any known examples of their
kind. They were performed from the manuscript, as finally
arranged for publication, by Frau Schumann and Dietrich at
a music party given by the Grand-Duchess of Oldenburg in
the autumn of 1866.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Joachim's prolonged visit to Austria came to an end in
the second week of the New Year with a farewell dinner given
in his honour by Brahms, Billroth, Hanslick, and other
friends, and a fortnight later he removed with his family
from Hanover to Berlin. His residence was permanently
fixed in the Prussian capital in the course of the following
year by his acceptance of the post of director of the Royal
High School for Music (executive art), which was about to be
founded by King William of Prussia (afterwards the German
Emperor William I.), as an addition to the State department
for Art and Science, and in the planning and practical
arrangement of which Joachim actively participated. Under
his devoted management, it quickly rose to the high state of
prosperity for which it has long been famous, and now, after
more than thirty-five years of existence, it still enjoys the
high advantage and distinction of his personal labour and
influence as director, conductor, and teacher. The occasion
of the opening in 1902, by the Emperor William II., of the
spacious new buildings of the Royal Schools for Art and
Science at Charlottenburg, of which the fine new music
school is one, must have seemed to the great veteran
musician, as he recalled the modest beginnings of his own
special department in 1869, as one that included the crowning
of much of the activity of his life.</p>

<p>Brahms quitted Vienna a few weeks after his friend to
fulfil a series of concert engagements, most of them arranged
with Stockhausen, for the months of February and March,
by which he hoped to make his journey to North Germany
on the business of the Requiem answer a practical as well
as an artistic purpose. He took up his headquarters at his
father's house, and it was the last time that he returned from
Vienna to Hamburg as to his nominal home. The post of
conductor of the Philharmonic had again fallen vacant in
1867 by Stockhausen's resignation, and again, though
Brahms did not apply for the appointment, there was a
strong conviction amongst his friends that he would accept
it if it were offered him. But it was not to be. Admired
and loved as he was in Hamburg by an ever-increasing circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of friends, it was by a circle only. He was not popular with
the average musician or the general public, and the Philharmonic
committee passed him over a second time, electing
Julius von Bernuth as Stockhausen's successor. Brahms
said little on the subject, but it is fairly certain that the
mortification caused him by this repeated slight from the
musical officialdom of his native city sufficed to lead him to
the determination at which he soon afterwards arrived, to
settle permanently in Vienna.</p>

<p>Brahms made several public appearances in Hamburg
during the second half of February. He performed, at the
Philharmonic concert of the 14th, Beethoven's G major Concerto
and Schumann's Etudes Symphoniques, adding to the
published version of the latter several variations contained
in Schumann's original manuscript. On the same occasion
Stockhausen sang Schubert's songs 'Memnon' and
'Geheimniss' to orchestral accompaniments arranged by
Brahms, at his request, a year or two previously. The composer
was able to spare a few days for Bremen, in order to
make Reinthaler's personal acquaintance, though his
numerous engagements for March obliged him to leave the
work of preparation and rehearsal in the experienced hands
of his new friend. He played at the Oldenburg subscription
concert of the 4th,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and gave concerts with Stockhausen
during the same week in Dresden and Berlin, appearing for
the first time before the public of either capital. At the
second concert in Berlin (March 7) Nos. 3 and 5 of the
'Magelone Romances' were included in the programme. On
the 11th the two artists gave a soir&eacute;e in Hamburg, when
Stockhausen introduced Brahms' 'Mailied' and 'Von
ewiger Liebe' from the manuscripts, and gave several folk-songs
as an encore. At Kiel, where they appeared on the
13th, they made the acquaintance of L&ouml;we, the famous
ballad composer, now a man of seventy-two, with whose
music Brahms proved to be thoroughly familiar. Their
next destination was Copenhagen, where they had arranged
to give four concerts. Stockhausen's selection on the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of these occasions included songs by Stradella, Schubert, and
Boieldieu, all accompanied by Brahms, who performed as
his solos a Toccata and Fugue by Sebastian Bach Andante
by Friedemann Bach, two Scarlatti movements, Beethoven's
Sonata in E flat, Op. 27, and, of his own compositions,
Variations on an original theme and the early Scherzo in
E flat minor. Both artists awakened a furore. Stockhausen
'electrified the house'; Brahms was 'enormously
applauded,' especially after the performance of his own
compositions. The second concert, given within the next
few days, was equally successful. The concert-room was
crowded, the audience extraordinarily enthusiastic, and the
financial result brilliant beyond expectation. Then Brahms
committed a <i>faux pas</i>, which put an end, so far as he was concerned,
to further result of the triumph.</p>

<p>Being asked, at a party given by the Danish composer
Niels Gade in his and Stockhausen's honour, if he had
visited and admired the great Thorwaldsen Museum, of which
the citizens of Copenhagen are so justly proud, he replied
in the affirmative, and added that the building and its collection
were so fine it was to be regretted they were not in
Berlin. This unfortunate remark, made in a circle representative
of educated Danish society, where the remembrance
of the recent Prussian occupation of Schleswig-Holstein
was still sore, produced an effect which the speaker
had been far from intending. It was regarded as a deliberate
insult to the country in which Brahms had been a
f&ecirc;ted guest, and was resented so strongly as to make the
composer's reappearance on a Copenhagen platform impossible.
Pursuing the wisest course open, he embarked on
the next boat for Kiel, leaving Stockhausen to make such
arrangements as he could for the third advertised concert,
and to pursue his success further by associating himself with
Joachim, who was about to pay a short visit to the Danish
capital.</p>

<p>Arriving at Kiel at a very early hour in the morning,
Brahms proceeded to the house of Claus Groth, whose guest
he had been on his outward journey, and, walking in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
garden until the inmates were astir, was presently greeted
by his friend from an upper window. 'Be quick and come
out; I have made a heap of money,' he cried in answer,
slapping his pocket. Coffee was soon served and a lively
talk ensued, but, as no explanation was offered by Brahms
of his sudden reappearance, Groth at length began to
question him. 'What have you been about that you have,
so to say, run away? Stockhausen has not returned, and
you have had great success?' And thus brought to the
point, the delinquent was obliged to relate his indiscretion.
'Brahms! how could you have said such a thing in a company
of Danes!' cried Groth. 'I only meant,' replied
Brahms, 'that it would be better if so fine a work, so many
beautiful objects, were in a great centre where many people
could see them.' 'But you might have supposed Danes
would not put up with such a remark.' 'It did not occur to
me,' answered Brahms. 'However,' he added after a
moment, 'I have earned so much money I shall not want
more for a long time; so the matter is indifferent to me.'</p>

<p>Brahms arrived in Bremen on the first day of April, to
remain until after the 10th as the guest of Reinthaler, with
whom he soon became intimate. Appreciation of his works
had steadily grown in the artistic circles of Bremen since the
musical life of the city had been under the leadership of the
distinguished artist whose name will remain associated with
the first performance of the then complete German
Requiem; and the Good Friday concert of this year was
anticipated with the interest attaching to an event of unusual
importance, the more so as many distinguished visitors
from far and near were expected to be present as performers
or in the audience. To the gratification of the former
members of the Ladies' Choir, Brahms expressed a wish
that the old favourite society should be represented in the
chorus, and four of the most enthusiastic and trusty of his
quondam disciples&mdash;Fr&auml;ulein Garbe, Fr&auml;ulein Reuter,
Fr&auml;ulein Seebohm, and Fr&auml;ulein Marie V&ouml;lckers&mdash;answered
to his summons, arriving at Bremen in time to take part in
the last general rehearsal. The programme of the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
concert, the proceeds of which were to be devoted to the
Bremen musicians' provident fund, included the German
Requiem (baritone solo, Stockhausen), between the first
and second parts of which, some of the miscellaneous items
were placed; movements by Bach and Tartini, and Schumann's
Abendlied for violin (Joachim); 'I know that my
Redeemer liveth' (Frau Joachim); air for contralto with
violin obligato from Bach's 'Matthew Passion' (Frau
Joachim and Joachim); and the 'Hallelujah' chorus.
Brahms was to conduct his new work, Reinthaler the
remaining selections. All the soloists gave their services.</p>

<p>The doors of St. Peter's Cathedral Church opened punctually
at six o'clock on Good Friday evening, and during the
next hour the visitors, many of them old acquaintances of
the reader, streamed to their places. Frau Reinthaler and
Frau Stockhausen were of course present. The Dietrichs,
with their friend Fr&auml;ulein Berninger, came from Oldenburg,
the Grimms from M&uuml;nster. The Hamburg contingent
included Minna V&ouml;lckers, the composer's former pupil and
very stanch friend, now grown up into a young lady, and
her father, who had invited Jakob Brahms to accompany
them as his guest. Max Bruch, Sch&uuml;bring, and young
Richard Barth were there. Switzerland was represented by
the future publisher of the Requiem, Rieter-Biedermann;
England by the enthusiastic John Farmer; and shortly
before the time of commencement Frau Schumann walked
up the nave on Brahms' arm. She had arranged that her
intention of making the journey from Baden-Baden with her
daughter Marie should be kept a secret from the composer,
and the two ladies surprised him with their greeting at the
cathedral door.</p>

<p>No pains had been spared in the preparation of chorus and
orchestra, and their difficult tasks were perfectly achieved.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The impression made by the wonderful, splendidly performed
work was quite overpowering,' says Dietrich, 'and
it immediately became clear to the listeners that the
German Requiem would live as one of the most exalted
creations of musical art.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>The composer, the executants, and their friends, to the
number of about a hundred, met for supper in the ancient
Rathskeller close to the cathedral, and listened afterwards
to a short address by Consul Hirschfeld and to about a
dozen other speeches.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It is with great pleasure and justifiable pride,' said
Reinthaler, 'that I greet this distinguished assemblage of
visitors, some of them gathered to perform, and others to
hear, the new work of the composer who is staying in our
midst. The circumstance that it has been performed for the
first time here in Bremen gives me quite peculiar happiness.
It is a great and beautiful&mdash;one may say, an epoch-making
work, which has filled us who have heard it to-day with pride,
since it has inspired in us the conviction that German art
has not died out, but that it begins to stir again and will
thrive as gloriously as of old.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'A gloomy, anxious period has intervened since our last
dear master was carried to the grave;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> it has almost seemed
as though the evening of musical art had fallen upon us;
but to-day we are reassured. In the German Requiem we
believe that we have a sequel worthy of the achievements
of the great masters of the past.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'That I have had the good fortune to contribute towards
ensuring a not quite unworthy performance of the work gives
me lively satisfaction. Everyone concerned, however, has
supported me to this end. Each has brought cheerful good-will
to his task, and devoted himself to it with active zeal
and unmixed enthusiasm, for each felt it to be an elevating
one.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'You will all certainly rejoice with me that the creator of
the glorious work is present amongst us and will joyfully
raise your glasses to the health of the composer, our
Brahms.'</p>

<p>Brahms' answer was characteristically short and to the
purpose:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'If I venture to say a few words to-night, I must premise
that the gift of oratory is in no wise at my command. There
are, however, amongst those present, many to whom I wish
to say a word of thanks, many dear friends who have been
kind and good to me, and this is especially the case with my
friend Reinthaler, who has given himself with such self-sacrifice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>to the preparation of my Requiem. I place my
collective thanks upon his head therefore, and call for three
cheers for his name.'</p>

<p>It may surprise and interest English readers to know that
their country was toasted on an occasion so peculiarly representative
of German music and musicians. After the various
artists who had assisted in the performance and one or two
of the other distinguished guests had been duly honoured,
John Farmer rose to his feet, and delivered himself of his
sentiments in such German as he could command.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I have come from a city,' he said, 'that is much larger
than Bremen, in which there are many fine houses and many
rich men. You, however, may be prouder than all the rich
men in the big houses, who are, indeed, very unfortunate.
They have no such beautiful music as you in Germany. If
you were to come to England, and Brahms himself were
to come with you, to perform the Requiem, they would
not attend the concert, or if they were to attend it they
would say, "Is the fellow crazy?" You can have no idea
how fortunate you are in being able to understand all this
beautiful music. Oh, I have observed and have perceived
that each one has followed it with love and the whole energy
of his soul! When I return to England, I shall relate what
I have seen, and will hope that we may, before long, become
as fortunate as yourselves and may be able to understand
and perform German music as you do.'</p>

<p>England found its defender in Herr Lehmann, who
immediately rose to reply:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I would venture, nevertheless, to say a word in England's
honour. So many artists have met with an encouraging
reception or have found a happy home there; there are so
many Englishmen who understand and sympathize with
German art and German life, that I would beg leave to propose
a glass to the honour of art-loving England.'</p>

<p>The feeling of satisfaction expressed in Reinthaler's speech
that the distinction of the first performance of the German
Requiem should have fallen to Bremen was generally
shared by the musicians and amateurs of the city.</p>

<p>'Reinthaler has, with laudable judgment, concentrated his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>best powers upon the arrangement of a concert which has
given to Bremen a distinctive artistic reputation,' says the
critic of the <i>Bremen Courier</i>, and the sentiment was expressed
practically, as well as verbally, in a communication sent to
the composer a few days after his return to Hamburg. The
work was repeated on Tuesday, April 28, in the hall of the
Union, under Reinthaler's direction, when the baritone solo
was sung by Franz Krolop.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to be able to associate with the musical
events of 1868&mdash;the year which, by virtue of the occurrences
now recorded, marked the beginning of a new period in
Brahms' outward career and established him in the eyes of
the musicians of Europe as the greatest living artist in his
own domain&mdash;the name of an early friend whose skilled
appreciation of his genius had cheered and encouraged him
in the dark days of his youth. Frau Dr. Louise Langhans-Japha
played the Quintet in F minor for pianoforte and
strings at her concert in the Salle Erard, Paris, on March 24,
and secured for it a very decided success. It is impossible
actually to affirm that the work was heard for the first time
in public in its final form on this occasion, but it is the first
public performance of which the author has been able to find
record.</p>

<p>Brahms stayed on in the north for several weeks after
the Good Friday concert at Bremen, and found time to pay
another, this time a holiday, visit to the Reinthalers, and
to make the acquaintance of many of their friends. He
derived particular pleasure from the society of some small
playfellows who welcomed him to Frau Reinthaler's nursery,
and struck up a special friendship with the eldest daughter
of the house, little Henriette. Hearing the child, hardly
out of baby years, practising the treble of a little pianoforte
duet, he proposed to take the bass, and, amusing himself by
striking a wrong note, was promptly rebuked by his colleague.
'You have played a wrong note,' said Misi,
stopping short. 'Nun, we must do it again,' returned
Brahms penitently, and recommenced. 'You have played
another!' cried Misi; nor could the master be pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
perfect in his part until after two more attempts. He
stayed, too, for a few days in Oldenburg, and whilst there
made several excursions in the neighbourhood with Dietrich
and Reinthaler. Driving one day to Wilhelmshaven, the
great northern war-harbour of Germany, he was unusually
absent-minded and serious, and mentioned that he had been
much struck with H&ouml;lderlin's poem, 'Hyperion's Song of
Destiny,' which he had read in the morning for the first time.
After inspecting the harbour and its sights, he withdrew to a
distant part of the beach, where he was observed by his
friends to be busy with pencil and paper. He was putting
down the first sketches of his now celebrated setting of the
work.</p>

<p>Brahms spent the remainder of the year in Germany and
Switzerland. After attending the Rhine Festival held the
last week of May in Cologne, he settled down for some months
at 6, Kessenicherweg, Bonn, in order to be near Dr. Deiters,
whom he met daily and admitted to his confidence on the
subject of his work. He was occupied with the final preparation
of the manuscript of the Requiem for the
engraver, and played it through to his friend, who had
already studied it from the manuscript, saying, in the course
of the just-completed fifth number, '... <i>I will comfort you
as a mother comforts</i>,' that here he had thought of his
mother.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He was engaged again, also, with the C minor
Pianoforte Quartet, which, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> has associations
with a very much earlier period, and played the sketches to
Dr. Deiters, though the work was not finally completed until
after the further lapse of several years. The music to
Goethe's cantata 'Rinaldo' was in progress, and was finished
shortly before he quitted Bonn. Deiters was fortunate
enough to have the opportunity of listening, at his own house
or in Brahms' rooms, to the composer's interpretation of some
of his published works, and to hear his own opinion of many
of his songs, which he estimated very variously. Amongst
those of which he thought most highly at this time was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
'Von ewiger Liebe,' published later in the year as No. 1 of
Op. 43.</p>

<p>Brahms was in happy summer mood throughout the time
of his sojourn on the Rhine. The fondness for dumb pets
that always characterized him, though he kept none of his
own, was gratified by the confidence of some pigeons that
used to fly into his room and come to him to be fed. He
invited his father to join him during the last ten days of his
stay, and pleased himself by showing him the Rhine country
and introducing him to his friend. It was the only year of
his life during which there was intimate personal intercourse
between himself and Deiters, but the two men remained in
correspondence, and the composer frequently sent copies of
his new works as they appeared, with an autograph inscription,
to the critic whose early appreciation through a period
when their personal acquaintance had been of the slightest
had awakened in him a strong feeling of regard and esteem.
'I feel under a great debt of obligation to friend Deiters,' he
says in the course of a letter to Dietrich written in 1867.</p>

<p>Jakob Brahms was not allowed to return to Hamburg
until he had a second time tested his capacity for enjoying
the delights of mountain scenery by accompanying his son
on a few weeks' journey in Switzerland; but though
Johannes made all possible arrangements to spare his father
fatigue, it became evident that he was very homesick.
'See, Johannes, here is a little blue flower like that which
grows near Hamburg,' he said one day, lagging a little behind
after he had walked some distance in silence. An incident
of the tour which pleased him, perhaps, better than his
pedestrian and driving experiences was the trial, at which he
was present, of the new movement of the Requiem, which
the composer wished to hear before delivering it for publication.
This was arranged for at Z&uuml;rich by Hegar. Frau
Suter-Weber undertook the soprano solo, and orchestra and
chorus were supplied by resident musicians. Jakob, on this,
as indeed on all occasions, fully appreciated the distinction
he derived from being his son's companion; but it is certain
that he was much relieved when the day came for him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
return to his quiet home and the unembarrassing society of
his wife. 'Nu, Line, krigt mi Johannes nit wieder hin'
(Now, Lina, Johannes will not get me again), he said, as
he settled himself once more in his own chair; and he kept
to his determination, though he compromised matters on one
or two subsequent occasions by accepting his son's proposal
that he should visit the Harz and other districts in Frau
Caroline's company.</p>

<p>Of the many pleasant social events of the year, a gathering
in the autumn at Dietrich's house in Oldenburg remains for
mention. Frau Schumann, her daughter Marie, and Brahms
enjoyed their old friends' hospitality during the last week of
October, and the visit was signalized by the first performance
from the manuscript, before a private audience, of the
Hungarian Dances in their arrangement for four hands on
the piano.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Frau Schumann and Brahms played them with an
inspiration and fire that transported everyone present,' says
Dietrich.</p>

<p>Frau Schumann gave an evening concert in the hall of the
Casino on the 30th, when her programme included her
performance with the composer&mdash;probably the first before a
public audience&mdash;of Brahms' Waltzes.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Brahms and Stockhausen again united their forces in
November, and gave several concerts together. At the first
of two soir&eacute;es in Hamburg, Brahms created a furore with
some of the Hungarian Dances in their arrangement as solos.
The programme included a performance by Stockhausen
and his pupil Fr&auml;ulein Girzik of two of the Duets, Op. 28,
the second of which was rapturously encored. Brahms, as
usual, accompanied his friend throughout the evening. He
was received with acclamation at Bremen on the 30th of the
month, when he played the pianoforte part of his A major
Quartet at a concert of the excellent resident string quartet
party led by Jacobsen, a fine player, and second concertmeister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of the Bremen orchestra. On this, as on subsequent
visits to Bremen, Brahms stayed, as a matter of
course, with the Reinthalers.</p>

<p>Carl Bade, paying one of his frequent morning calls at the
Anscharplatz about this time, was startled as he entered the
house by the appearance of Jakob, who, coming towards him
with finger on lip and laboriously treading on tiptoe, solemnly
whispered, 'Hush!...' 'What is it, Brahms? Who is
ill?' returned Bade under his breath, seriously alarmed.
'Hush!' repeated Jakob as mysteriously as before; '<i>he is
dor</i>' (he is there); and, opening the door of the corner
room, he pushed in the astonished Carl and shut the door
behind him without another word, leaving him alone with
his son, who was busy weeding out his library in readiness
for the despatch of his Hamburg possessions to Vienna.
'See here,' said Johannes, after a kind word of greeting,
giving Bade time to recover the composure of which Jakob's
strange <i>coup</i> had for a moment robbed him, by pointing to a
volume in his hand, 'Kuhnau was a capable musician!'</p>

<p>The relation existing at this time between the elder and
younger Brahms, of which mention was made in an early
chapter, was well illustrated during the homely 'second
breakfast' for which the party soon assembled. Sociability
was rendered impossible, in spite of the persistent efforts of
Johannes, by the father's overwhelming consciousness of
his son's presence. The awed feeling which possessed Jakob
whenever he found himself face to face with the living
embodiment of his own miraculous success in life was not
unnatural, and can only inspire respect for the memory of
the older man, in whose simple humility, rooted in the
strongest and most legitimate pride, may, perhaps, be recognised
some of the essential qualities which endeared the great
composer to all who were privileged to call him friend.</p>

<p>Brahms returned to Vienna in December, and was, of
course, present at several concerts given there before and
after Christmas by Frau Schumann, who visited Austria
after an interval of some years.</p>

<p>The list of publications belonging to this year is an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
one, not only because it includes the German
Requiem (Rieter-Biedermann), but because it is representative
of the master in what may be roughly called the
second period of his activity as a composer of songs. From
beginning to end of his career he poured forth songs in many
different forms&mdash;the simple strophic, the 'durchcomponirtes'
Lied, the latter necessarily varying in structure
with each fresh example.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This second period, however, is
marked not only by the sure mastery which had long characterized
Brahms' works in whatever domain he chose for
the exercise of his powers; its spirit is generally distinctive,
and is that of the poet's ripe manhood. Youth with its
uncertainties is behind, age with its gathering shadows not
yet in sight; the composer holds the present in firm grasp,
and presents us with exquisite dream-pictures of life and
nature, the children of an imagination penetrated with a
sense of the beauty, the tenderness, the pathos of existence,
and content in the exercise of its ideality. Each of the five
books published in 1868 (Op. 43 by Rieter-Biedermann, and
Op. 46, 47, 48, 49 by Simrock) contains such wealth of
beauty that it is difficult to select either for particular
mention. Perhaps the palm should be given to Op. 43, of
which 'Von ewiger Liebe' and 'Mainacht' are Nos. 1 and 2;
but then, Op. 47 contains 'Botschaft,' and Op. 46 'Die
Schale der Vergessenheit.' Stockhausen, who stayed at
Neuenahr in the summer of 1868, came over to Bonn one
day, and sang the greater number of these songs from the
manuscript, accompanied by the composer, to Deiters.
Brahms seemed determined not to publish 'Die Schale der
Vergessenheit,' declaring it to be too 'desolate,' but Stockhausen's
enthusiasm prevailed to alter his decision. Some
of the shorter numbers belong, by date of composition, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
an earlier period, as Goethe's 'Die Liebende schreibt,' the
manuscript of which, in the possession of Frau Professor
B&ouml;ie, bears the inscription 'Frl. Marie V&ouml;lckers in kind
remembrance' and the date 1863. The widely popular
'Wiegenlied,' Op. 49, No. 4, was composed for one of Frau
Faber's children, and the accompaniment is reminiscent of
a folk-song which Brahms heard from Fr&auml;ulein Bertha
Porubszky in the old days of the Hamburg Ladies' Choir.
The manuscript bears the inscription 'For Arthur and
Bertha Faber for ever happy use. July 1868'; and at the
close 'Mit Grazie in infinitum,' and is in the possession of
these old friends of the composer.</p>

<p>Now, as ever, Brahms returned with delight to the fresh
na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the folk-song, and numerous examples of his
settings of texts obtained from German, Bohemian, Italian
sources are to be found in these books, of which 'Sonntag,'
Op. 47, No. 3, and 'Am Sonntag Morgen,' Op. 49, No. 1,
are perhaps the best known. 'Gold &uuml;berwiegt die Liebe'
is a touching little lament (No. 4 of Op. 48). The text of
'Von ewiger Liebe' is itself a Wendic folk-song, but the
composer's treatment has placed it amongst the finest works
of German art in song-form. As a rule, however, Brahms
set folk-songs as such, and his treatment of them was direct,
and, so to say, unstudied. He has set for a single voice
popular texts of more than twenty nationalities besides his
own, and, as he found them, as they appealed to him, so he
composed them, without attempt either to interfere with the
frank naturalness of the words, or to give national colour to
his music. Such musical references as he occasionally
makes in his songs to the origin of his texts are so unobtrusive
as to be hardly noticeable, excepting by a special student
of the subject.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> 'Vergangen ist mir,' Op. 48, No. 6, points
back to the tonal system of the Middle Ages. Like
'Sehnsucht,' Op. 14, No. 8, it is composed in the Dorian mode.</p>

<p>The enumeration of the great song publications of 1868 is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
not yet at an end. The issue by Rieter-Biedermann of
Books 3, 4, 5, containing in all nine numbers, of the 'Magelone
Romances,' of which the first two books had appeared
in 1865, completed a song-cycle which ranks among the few
supreme achievements of its class, increasing to the number
of four a special group of names which had hitherto included
those only of Beethoven, Schubert, and Schumann.</p>

<p>The fifteen 'Magelone Romances' are extremely various
in structure, and can hardly be classified categorically under
any of the ordinary song-forms. Spitta expresses his sense
of their importance by the word 'symphonic.' Brahms'
own name 'Romance' sufficiently indicates their nature,
however. Some are of great, others of smaller, dimensions.
Some consist of several movements, others of one short
movement in three sections, of which the last repeats the
first; one is bound into a whole by the melody of a refrain.
They give vivid expression to a wide range of feelings:
chivalric delight, progressive phases of passionate love, the
despair of separation, reawakened hope, the confident bliss
of reunion, certainty of the sacred power of love. Remembrance
of the ideal performances of Stockhausen, to whom
the cycle is dedicated, was indubitably present to Brahms'
mind as he composed the songs, which, with the exception
of Nos. 11 and 13, should be sung by a man. One may
read and reread them, hear them and hear them again,
but try in vain to decide on a favourite number. Each
one places the listener in an enchanted world of noble beauty
and romance, and in wealth and individuality of idea the
cycle assuredly does not rank last amongst the few works of
its kind.</p>

<p>The Songs and Romances Op. 44 mentioned in our first
volume in connection with the Ladies' Choir were now also
published by Rieter-Biedermann;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and Cranz of Hamburg
issued the three Songs for six-part Chorus <i>a capella</i>, Op. 42,
all of great charm. Its five-bar rhythm is an interesting
feature of the second number, the lovely 'Vineta.' The
text of No. 3, 'Darthula's Grabesgesang,' is a translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
from Ossian, and is contained in Herder's 'Stimmen der
V&ouml;lker.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms is here,' writes Billroth from Vienna on
January 11, 'and is to give concerts with Stockhausen. He
is going to bring out a cantata, Rinaldo, in February....
He is enthusiastic about the text because it leaves
so much to the composer.'</p>

<p>Goethe wrote his cantata expressly that music might be
set to it by Capellmeister Winter, a respectable musician of
his day, for the Prince Friedrich of Gotha, the possessor of
an agreeable tenor voice, and a good amateur vocalist. It
is founded on an episode in Tasso's 'Jerusalem Delivered,'
and exhibits the conflict between weakness and strength in
the brave knight Rinaldo&mdash;a fictitious personage introduced
into his poem by Tasso&mdash;who is roused from his surrender to
the witcheries of Armida by the arrival, at the islet on which
he is living with her, of a party of knights, his friends&mdash;two
only in Tasso's epic, but increased to a chorus by Goethe.
The cantata opens at a point where the knights have succeeded
in awakening Rinaldo from his dream of happiness,
but are unable to nerve him to the resolution of departure.
As a final resource, they hold up before him a diamond shield,
which reflects his own image in its degeneracy. The shock
of what he sees restores him to full consciousness, and he
leaves the island in spite of Armida's lamentations, fury, and
enchantments, and his own regrets, encouraged and supported
by his friends. The final chorus with solo depicts
the happy return voyage, and the safe arrival of the ship at
the shore of the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Armida does not appear as a <i>dramatis persona</i> in Goethe's
work, and Brahms' music is accordingly composed for tenor
solo, men's chorus, and orchestra. The poem is short and
concise, containing but one dramatic situation, but its very
terseness has been advantageous to the composer, for the
text has not fettered his imagination by detail, whilst it has
supplied him with sufficient material for powerful and contrasted
musical presentation in the enchantments of Armida,
the storm raised by her to prevent the ship's departure, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
calm, persuasive firmness of the knights, the vacillation of
Rinaldo (expressed in the first instance in an impassioned
scena), his pleadings with his friends, his final awakening
and recovery from the intensity of passion. Of all these
points Brahms has availed himself with force and warmth
of imagination. Many interesting details of the composition
tempt our notice, but we may only stay to direct the reader's
attention to the conviction inspired by the choruses of the
noble, lovable character of the knights; to the masterly
means employed&mdash;so simple that only a master would have
ventured to restrict himself to them&mdash;at the moment when
the shield is displayed, which, in their place, convey, without
any attempt at tone-painting, but with absolute distinctness,
the impression of the friends' gentle determination with the
shrinking Rinaldo; to the bright martial movement in
which the knights encourage him by reminding him of the
flashing lances, the waving pennons, the whole brilliant battle
array, of the crusaders' army from which the allurements of
Armida have too long detained him. In the final chorus a
favourable wind swells the sails of the ship, which rides
joyously over the green waves, breaking them into light foam
as she passes, whilst Rinaldo and his companions amuse
themselves by watching the dolphins at play in the water,
and are filled with a light-hearted happiness that, as land
is sighted, bursts into exultant shouting of the names of
Godfrey and Solyma (Jerusalem).</p>

<p>The work was performed for the first time from the manuscript,
under the composer's direction, on February 28, 1869,
at a concert of the Akademischer Gesangverein, Vienna.
The title-part was sung with great success by Gustav Walter,
three hundred students well prepared by Dr. Eyrich, the
society's conductor, were responsible for the choruses, and
the orchestral accompaniments were performed by the entire
body of instrumentalists of the court opera.</p>

<p>A series of three concerts, given in Vienna in February and
March by Brahms and Stockhausen were phenomenally
successful. The great baritone had not been heard in the
Austrian capital for many years, and all tickets for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
concert were sold immediately after its announcement.
Brahms' selection for the series included works by Handel,
Bach, Couperin, Gluck, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann,
some of his own Variations&mdash;notably those of the B flat
Sextet&mdash;and Hungarian Dances; and he accompanied his
friend in many of the most celebrated songs of his r&eacute;pertoire.
The wonderful performance by the two artists of Brahms'
songs 'Von ewiger Liebe' and 'Mainacht' was one of the
choice delights of the first concert. A feature of the second
was the performance by Stockhausen and Fr&auml;ulein Girzik of
two of the composer's vocal duets. The enthusiasm excited
by the concert-givers in Vienna was equalled in Budapest,
whither they proceeded on March 10, in order to give a similar
series; and it was, if possible, exceeded on their final
reappearance in Vienna.</p>

<p>These concerts are of peculiar interest in Brahms' career,
because the last of them closes the period of his activity as
a virtuoso. For fourteen years, from the autumn of 1855
to the spring of 1869, circumstances had obliged, and happily
permitted, him to earn his livelihood chiefly by the exercise
of his powers as an executive artist; but his reputation as a
composer had grown uninterruptedly throughout this time,
and with the production of the German Requiem it
attained a height that gave him future independence of
action. Though years were still to pass before his circumstances
became easy, they were not again straitened, and
from henceforth he undertook concert-journeys only in the
r&ocirc;le of a composer, to assist at performances of his own works.
The occasions on which he appeared additionally as pianist
with one of Beethoven's or Schumann's great compositions
became less and less frequent, moreover, as, with passing
time, he felt increasingly out of regular practice. Brahms
was, in later life, fond of illustrating the fact of his long
struggle with poverty by referring to the manuscript of the
Requiem. 'The paper is of all sizes and shapes, because
at the time I wrote it I never had money enough to buy a
stock.' The immediate impression created by the great
work was, however, sufficiently widespread and profound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
place the composer alone, among the musicians of his day,
as the accepted representative of the classical art of Germany,
and the prices commanded by his copyrights gradually
increased accordingly. No long time elapsed before the
German Requiem had made the round of the musical
cities of Europe. It was given, for the first time after final
completion and publication, at the Leipzig Gewandhaus
concert of February 18, 1869, under Reinecke, and was performed
in the course of the next few weeks in Basle (twice),
Carlsruhe (twice), M&uuml;nster, Cologne, Hamburg, Z&uuml;rich, and
Weimar, and, later in the year, in Dessau (twice), Chemnitz
(twice), Barmen (four choruses only), Magdeburg, Jena, and
again twice in Cologne. The complete work was not heard
in Vienna until March 5, 1871, when it was given by the
Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde under the composer's direction,
with Frau Wilt and Dr. Krauss as soloists, but achieved
no striking success. It was performed on July 7 of the same
year (1871) for the first time in England, before an invited
audience, at the residence of Sir Henry Thompson. Stockhausen
conducted the rehearsals and performance, and sang
the baritone solo, Fr&auml;ulein Anna Regan the soprano solo.
The chorus was composed of about thirty good musicians,
and the accompaniments were played in their arrangement
as a pianoforte duet by Lady Thompson and the veteran
musician Cipriani Potter, then in his eightieth year. The
first public performance in England which the author has
been able to authenticate with precision is that of the
Philharmonic Society in St. James's Hall on April 2, 1873,
under the direction of W. G. Cusins, when the soloists were
Mlle. Sophie Ferrari and Santley. The work was performed
for the first time in Berlin, Munich and St. Petersburg
in the spring, and in Utrecht in June, of the year 1872,
and in Paris in 1874.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably it was due to the impression created by the
German Requiem that the Serenade in D, Op. 11, was
performed for the first time in Berlin in November, 1869,
at one of the concerts of the Symphony Orchestra under
Capellmeister Stern.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The reception showed that the public is beginning to
understand and value the composer Brahms, one of the few
living creative artists who are genuine and sincere,' wrote a
Berlin critic.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of the same year Louis Brassin played
the Handel Variations and Fugue in Munich with very great
success. Brassin was one of the first artists to perform the
work in public, and that he introduced it to a Munich
audience is the more interesting since the musicians of the
Bavarian capital had in 1869 shown scant, if any, recognition
of our composer's art, which was too progressive for Franz
Lachner, and too conservative for von B&uuml;low, the successive
leaders, up to that date, of the musical life of the city. The
work was played by B&uuml;low in November, 1872, in Carlsruhe,
and from that time was heard at his concerts with increasing
frequency.</p>

<p>The theory that found wide acceptance during the lifetime
of Brahms, and was discussed at length in a feuilleton of
the <i>Strassburger Post</i> immediately after his death, that he
never had and never could have seriously entertained the
idea of composing for the stage, was long ago conclusively
refuted by Widmann in his 'Recollections.' He shows
that the master's wishes pointed at more than one period
of his career in the direction of dramatic composition, and
that he was prevented from following them by the same
difficulty which proved insoluble to Mendelssohn&mdash;that of
finding a libretto to suit his fancy.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'He was always particularly animated when speaking of
matters connected with the theatre, as for instance when
he once very decidedly demonstrated to me the vaudeville
character of the first act of "Fidelio," which generally
passes for a very good text-book. He possessed a genuine
dramatic perception, and it gave him real pleasure to
analyze the merits and defects of a dramatic subject.'<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The interest of this passage is enhanced by a few words
that occur in an article on Brahms by Richard Heuberger:<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'We sat together the whole evening and I remember that
Brahms spoke in detail of Mozart's "Figaro" and laid
stress on the unparalleled manner in which Mozart has overcome
the enormous difficulties of his text; "Mozart has
composed it, not as a mere ordinary text-book, but as a
complete, well-organized comedy."'</p>

<p>It would certainly have been matter for surprise if Brahms,
who was peculiarly sensitive to the influence of really
poetic dramatic effect, and whose interest in the drama
furnished him with a source of frequent pleasure that did
not diminish as he grew older&mdash;he rarely missed a premi&egrave;re
at the Vienna Burg Theater&mdash;had passed through life without
feeling the inclination to test his powers as a composer for
the stage, and this is very far indeed from being the case.
Widmann's account of what took place between himself and
Brahms on the subject of opera belongs to the late seventies,
and we shall revert to it in its place; it points back, however,
to an earlier time, which proves, as we might expect,
to be that of the composer's intimacy with Devrient and
Levi, with whose varied professional activity he manifested
the warmest sympathy, and especially to the year 1869,
when the publication of the German Requiem had left
his mind at leisure for new important effort. Perhaps we
may perceive the direction in which his wishes were moving
in the fact that 'Rinaldo,' which contains the nearest
approach to dramatic composition to be found in the
catalogue of Brahms' works, was completed almost simultaneously
with the Requiem; and it is possible that an
indication of the obstacle that was to prove insuperable to
their fulfilment may be read in Billroth's words quoted in
the last chapter: 'Brahms is enthusiastic about [the text
of] Rinaldo because it leaves so much to the composer.'
However this may be, it is certain that he was strongly
possessed at this period and on into the early seventies with
the desire to compose an opera, and that he not only opened
his mind unreservedly on the subject to his friends at
Carlsruhe, but made repeated efforts in other directions to
procure a libretto adapted to his views. Allgeyer furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
him with a completed text-book on Calderon's 'The Open
Secret.' Through Claus Groth he obtained an unused text
written for Mendelssohn by the poet Geibel, founded on the
episode of Nausikaa in the 'Odyssey,'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and amongst others
with whom he discussed the subject were Tourgenieff at
Baden-Baden, who provided him with sketches, and,
Heinrich Bulthaupt, then a rising young dramatic author
and an intimate friend of Reinthaler's.</p>

<p>To Bulthaupt he proposed as a subject Schiller's fragment
of a play 'Demetrius,' which he esteemed very highly, and,
in a long conversation with this gentleman at his house in
Bremen, he explained with precision his ideas as to the
desirable treatment even of the minuti&aelig; of dramatic action,
taking as the theme of his exposition the libretto, written by
Bulthaupt, of Reinthaler's opera 'K&auml;tchen von Heilbronn.'
Some of the peculiarities of his views which created for him
unnecessary difficulties must be attributed to his inveterately
logical habit of mind, which made it repugnant to him to take
certain things for granted for the sake of stage exigencies.
He went too far in a desire that the minor details of the
drama should be visibly developed. Pointing to a scene
in 'K&auml;tchen von Heilbronn,' in the course of which three
soldiers go into a drinking cellar, not to reappear, he
inquired: 'What becomes of them?' 'It is assumed that
they go away,' replied Bulthaupt; 'do you mean to say
that you wish actually to see them come out again on to the
stage?' 'I should like to do so,' Brahms answered. A
moment's reflection would, of course, have shown him that
the scene in question was, in fact, realistic, since the soldiers
might in actual life have left the cellar by a back-door,
unseen by those who observed them enter through the
front one. The anecdote is, however, illustrative of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
mental habit which must have confronted Brahms with
countless difficulties so long as he merely contemplated the
composition of an opera. The work of composing one, had
he ever settled down to it, might probably have solved
many of them.</p>

<p>The idea of 'Demetrius' fell through. Bulthaupt suggested
to Brahms a consideration which, in no way applicable
to Schiller's piece, seemed to him of importance in view of
its adaptation as an opera. He thought that the necessity
of introducing some amount of Russian colouring into the
music of a drama having for its subject an episode of
Russian history, not only might prove irksome to a composer
so strongly imbued as Brahms with the sentiment of
German nationality, but would be prejudicial to the tragic
breadth of Schiller's play as it stands. Brahms, on thinking
over the matter, probably felt the weight of his friend's
remarks, for he did not return to his proposal.</p>

<p>Points of interest in the composer's suggestion of Schiller's
'Demetrius' for the subject of a tragic opera are that
ambition and not love is the mainspring of its action, and
that the feminine interest of the piece is centred neither in
maiden nor wife, but in Marfa, the mother of Demetrius, in
whom are exhibited powerful emotions arising from unerring
maternal instinct and baffled affection. It recalls the
period, moreover, when Brahms and Joachim shared each
other's daily thoughts on all subjects. Joachim composed
an overture to Hermann Grimm's play of 'Demetrius' in
1854, and, about the middle of the seventies, the well-known
'Marfa' scena for contralto and orchestra from
Schiller's fragment. A similar association is presented in
Brahms' favourite suggestion for the text-book of a serio-comic
opera or operetta, of Gozzi's 'K&ouml;nig Hirsch,' the
work with which Joachim's 'Overture to a Play of Gozzi's'
is to be connected. Arrangements by Brahms of both
these compositions of his friend, as pianoforte duets, were
found in his rooms after his death, and were published
with the very few manuscripts that he allowed to survive
him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Brahms travelled to Carlsruhe in March in order to
conduct the repetition performance of the German
Requiem, but except for this journey spent the early part
of the year 1869 quietly in Vienna. The advance of spring
induced him to pay some visits in the north, after which he
proceeded to Lichtenthal. The event of the season in Frau
Schumann's private circle was the marriage of her third
daughter Julie to the Conte Radicati di Marmorito. The
legend of an attachment between Brahms and this lady has
obtained sufficiently wide credence to demand mention in
our pages. It is, perhaps, not unnatural that the composer's
dedication to Fr&auml;ulein Julie Schumann of his Variations
for two pianofortes on her father's theme, published in
1863, should have led a few enthusiasts to draw their
own romantic conclusions, and that such conclusions should
have spread; the less so since Fr&auml;ulein Julie was possessed
of a graceful charm that made her interesting to all who
were brought into near contact with her. Brahms was not
an exception from others in his power of appreciating her
attraction, but his admiration of his old friend's daughter
at no time advanced into special intimacy. 'I have spent
the summer at Baden, and am going to remain for Julie
Schumann's wedding,' he writes to Dietrich. Brahms, Levi,
and Allgeyer together presented the bride with an <i>objet
d'art</i>, a bronze plate, and are represented contemplating it
in a group in a photograph of the time. The Contessa
Radicati di Marmorito was taken by death from her
husband and children after a few years of happiness.</p>

<p>The completed musical fruits of Brahms' year were the
Liebeslieder Walzer and the Rhapsody for contralto solo,
men's chorus and orchestra. The 'Liebeslieder,' waltzes
for pianoforte duet and <i>ad libitum</i> vocal quartet, composed
to a number of verses from Daumer's 'Polydora,' translations
or imitations of Russian and Polish folk-songs, are
amongst the most popular of the composer's works, and are
too familiar to need detailed comment. They show Brahms
in his perfection of dainty grace and fresh, playful imagination,
a mood in which he stands unrivalled. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
performed for the first time in public at the subscription
concert of the Carlsruhe court orchestra of October 6.
Frau Schumann, who played Beethoven's G major Concerto
on the same occasion, and Levi, were the pianists, and
Fr&auml;ulein Hausmann, Frau Hauser, Herr K&uuml;rner, and Herr
Brouillet, the singers. Published shortly afterwards by
Simrock, they were heard in Vienna before the close of the
year at the first Singakademie concert of the season; and
were performed at Frau Schumann's concert in Vienna of
January 5, 1870, by the concert-giver and composer and
the singers Frau Dustmann, Fr&auml;ulein Girzik, Herr Gustav
Walter, and Dr. Krauss.</p>

<p>The Rhapsody was first heard privately at the rehearsal
of the Carlsruhe concert of October 6, Levi having arranged
a performance for the benefit of Frau Schumann and of
Brahms himself. The solo was sung by Frau Boni. The
composer, writing to Deiters in September, says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... I should like to make a request to-day. I remember
to have seen at your house a volume of songs by Reichhardt
(possibly Zelter) which contained a stanza from Goethe's
Harzreise. Could you lend me the volume for a little
while?</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I need hardly add that I have just composed it and
should like to see the work of my forerunner. I call my
piece "Rhapsody," but believe I am indebted also for
the title to my respected predecessor.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I shall hear it in a few days, and should I then decide
not to print or perform the somewhat intimate music, I shall
nevertheless show it to you.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>It seems probable, from the circumstances of the first
public performance of the Rhapsody, that Madame Viardot-Garcia
was amongst the small audience on this private
occasion. The work was given on March 3, 1870, soon
after its publication, at the Academic Concerts, Jena, under
the direction of the society's conductor, Dr. Ernst Naumann,
when Madame Viardot sang the solo; 'Rinaldo,' with
Dr. Wiedemann as tenor, being included in the programme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Viardot-Garcia, staying early in 1870 with Liszt,
who had returned to Weimar in 1869 after an absence of
many years, met at his house his devoted friend Geheimrath
Gille, a distinguished musical amateur, who occupied an
official post at Jena and employed the greater part of his
leisure in the interest of the musical culture of the little
university town. Gille had in his youth known Goethe
and Hummel, and been on terms of close friendship with
Henselt. His intimacy with Liszt dated from the commencement
of the great man's residence in Weimar, and he
soon became a warm supporter of the New-German party,
received Wagner into his house at Jena on his flight from
Dresden to Liszt at Weimar, and saw him safely over the
German border. His sympathy with the new tendencies
did not render him insensible to the value of less revolutionary
developments of art. He had great interest and
respect to spare for Brahms' music, and encouraged its
cultivation by Brendel's society (Allgemeiner Deutscher
Musikverein), on the committee of which he was very active.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
There can be little doubt that the performance of the
Rhapsody at Jena in March was the outcome of a friendly
chat between Madame Viardot and himself and of their
mutual sympathetic admiration of Brahms' art, which was
shared by Dr. Ernst Naumann, an old personal acquaintance
of the composer. Since the performance of the German
Requiem in 1869 already chronicled, up to the present day,
Brahms' music has been well represented in the programmes
of the Jena societies under Naumann's direction.</p>

<p>The Rhapsody was given on March 19 under Grimm at
M&uuml;nster, and a little later at Capellmeister Hegar's benefit
concert at Z&uuml;rich. It became a favourite work with
Frau Joachim, who sang the solo times innumerable
with extraordinary power and sympathy and invariable
success.</p>

<p>Brahms' Rhapsody, Op. 53, is composed to a fragment&mdash;set
also by J. F. Reichhardt (1752-1814)&mdash;from Goethe's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
'Harzreise im Winter,' which has for its subject the poet's
reflections on a visit paid by him to a young hypochondriac
whose melancholy had, as he feared, been confirmed by the
influence of his own 'Werther's Sorrows.' Goethe's efforts
to raise the youth from his state of mental depression had
no immediate visible result, though he ultimately recovered
from his malady, and the three verses selected from the poem
for musical composition conclude with a prayer to the
Father of love on his behalf. Such a text was eminently
suited for musical expression by a composer who, intensely
realizing the problems of life, shaped his course by faith in
the power of love; and the Rhapsody furnishes another
striking illustration of the strength of imagination which
enabled Brahms so to absorb himself in his text as to be
able to present it in musical sound&mdash;to capable listeners&mdash;with
a strength and reality usually associated only with
impressions of sight. Let anyone who is familiar with the
composition read through Goethe's poem from beginning
to end, and note the accession of force with which the
verses set to music by Brahms come home to him. He will
be reminded of an object illuminated by sunlight that
stands near others placed in shadow.</p>

<p>The first of the three sections of the single movement that
constitutes the Rhapsody, an impressive orchestral picture
upon which the independent recitative of the solo voice
enters, may be accepted as the reflection of the poet's
intense realization of the unhappy youth's condition. Its
tones convey a penetrating impression of rich warmth and
pity lying behind the deepest gloom. The feeling of the
second section is no less concentrated, though it is expressed
with more calm:</p>

<p class="lyrics">
'Ah! how comfort his sorrows<br />
Who in balsam found poison?<br />
Who from the fulness of love<br />
Hath drunk but the hate of men?<br />
Once despised, now a despiser,<br />
Secretly he consumeth<br />
All his own best worth<br />
In fruitless self-seeking.'
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>The noble declamatory passages of the voice are supported
by an accompaniment that becomes agitated or intensely
still in accord with the course of the poet's self-questionings,
which reach their only possible and beautiful resolution in
the third section:</p>

<p class="lyrics">
'If thy Psalt'ry containeth,<br />
Father of love, one tone<br />
That can reach his ear,<br />
Oh, refresh his heart!<br />
Open his obscur&egrave;d sight<br />
To the thousand sources<br />
Near to the thirsty one<br />
In the desert.'
</p>

<p>Here, by a fine inspiration, the chorus of men's voices
enters for the first time <i>pianissimo</i>, supporting the solo
voice in fervent supplication.</p>

<p>Words and music are fitly associated throughout the
movement, which is a treasure amongst works of art, and
it is impossible to say that either of its parts is superior to
the others, though the divine outpouring of love and pity
in the last section often seems to appeal, especially, to the
hearer listening for the first time to the composition. This,
however, is really due to its position, which contains and
brings to an issue the effect of what precedes it. The work
has long since been generally recognised as one of the finest
of Brahms' shorter compositions, and continues to be more
in demand every year, though it had no great immediate
success.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I send you my Rhapsody,' Brahms wrote to Dietrich in
February, 1870, a week or two after its publication; 'the
music-directors are not exactly enthusiastic about the
opus, but it may, perhaps, be a satisfaction to you that I
do not always go in frivolous 3/4 time!'</p>

<p>It sprang from the composer's very soul.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'He once told me he loved it so,' says Dietrich, 'that he
placed it under his pillow at night in order to have it near
him.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The Studies without opus number, Nos. 1 and 2, after
Chopin and Weber, were published in 1869 by Senff; and the
first two books of Hungarian Dances by Simrock, in the duet
form for Pianoforte in which they obtained enormous
popularity. It was not until 1872 that they were issued
in the arrangement as solos, in which, as we know, they had
formed part of Brahms' r&eacute;pertoire during some years of his
virtuoso career.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Dunkl, a publisher of Budapest, used
to relate in after-years that Brahms, on the occasion of one
of his early appearances in that city, called on him and
offered a selection of six of the Dances for an absurdly small
sum. Dunkl said he would give his answer after hearing
them in the evening. They had no success and the publisher
refused them, a proceeding which he afterwards found
considerable reason to regret.</p>

<p>The stirring events of the year 1870, the series of triumphs
won by German arms, and the federation of the various
independent States under the headship of Prussia which
was to lead to the extraordinary development of German
political power and industrial progress that has been witnessed
by the present generation, were followed by our
composer with a mixture of ardent emotions, in which that of
swelling patriotic pride gained the predominance as each
day brought news of fresh victories won by the soldiers of
the Fatherland. His vehement exultation at the results
of the war found embodiment in a great 'Song of Triumph'
for chorus and orchestra, with which he was occupied in
1871, and the first chorus, completed early in the year, and
sent at once to Reinthaler, was performed from the manuscript
in Bremen Cathedral on Good Friday, April 7, under
the composer's direction, at a concert given by the Singakademie
in memory of those who had fallen in the war.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
There is no need to dilate on the feelings which dominated
Brahms during the writing of this extraordinary work.
They blaze out of it with an intensity and an endurance of
passion that well fit it to occupy its own peculiar place
amongst the great events that startled Europe at the
opening of the seventies. It commemorates heroic deeds
in truly heroic strains. By his choice of a text the composer
at once raised the scope of his work to a level above that
of an ordinary <i>Te Deum</i> for victory in war; and the words
selected by him from Revelation xix., which admit,
throughout each portion of the composition, of an application
to the overpowering occurrences of the time, were
precisely those for whose setting he alone of modern composers&mdash;we
may even say of all composers who have succeeded
the two giants of the eighteenth century&mdash;was, by
his temperament, genius, and attainments, pre-eminently
fitted.</p>

<p>The Triumphlied consists of three great movements for
double chorus and orchestra, the third of which contains a
few passages for baritone solo.</p>

<p>'<i>Alleluia; salvation and glory and honour and power unto
the Lord our God: For true and righteous are his judgments.</i>'</p>

<p>The solemnly jubilant orchestral prelude, the entry of
the full double chorus with loud and sustained Alleluias,
lead to the principal theme of the first movement, already
suggested in the prelude, and derived&mdash;though this is hardly
appreciable by the unpractised ear of a general audience&mdash;from
the Prussian national air, which is identical with
England's 'God save the King.' This theme or some
portion of it almost invariably accompanies the phrase,
'<i>Salvation, honour</i>, etc., <i>unto the Lord</i>,' which, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
surrounding Alleluias, forms the text of the first portion of
the movement, constructed entirely from diatonic harmonies.
The words '<i>For righteous and true are his judgments</i>' are
set to the broad themes of the middle portion, to which some
heightened effect is imparted by very sparing use of the more
familiar chromatic chords. The third section is a varied
repetition of the first with a coda. The movement is sustained
at the white heat of jubilation until the beginning
of the close, when a few tranquil bars, in the course of which
the voices die away to rest, and the instruments are subdued
to a <i>pianissimo</i> that becomes ever softer, prepare for the
glorious outburst with which the chorus terminates. The
second movement has three varying sections:</p>

<p>'<i>Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him,
great and small.</i></p>

<p>'<i>Alleluia, for the Almighty God hath entered into his
kingdom.</i></p>

<p>'<i>Let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him.</i>'</p>

<p>The first section opens with pure melodious beauty and
lofty serenity, and displays in its course numerous points of
imitation, direct and by inversion, which are easily discoverable
by the student. It is succeeded by a blast of trumpets,
an outburst of Alleluias, and the announcement of the
Lord's reign by the voices of the two choirs which enter
successively on a sounding tonic pedal; the basses imitating
the basses, then the tenors the tenors, and so on, at half a
bar's distance. This proclamation section is appropriately
concise and of superb grandeur. We hear in it 'as it were
the voice of a multitude, and as the voice of many waters,
and as the voice of mighty thunderings'; whilst the third
section, partly woven, by various kinds of imitation, from
the phrases of 'Nun danket Alle Gott,' which is sounded
prominently by the flutes and trumpets, is animated by
a singularly na&iuml;ve spirit of light-hearted happiness and
rejoicing.</p>

<p>'<i>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse: and
he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in
righteousness he doth judge and make war.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>And he treadeth, the winepress of the fierceness and wrath
of Almighty God.</i></p>

<p>'<i>And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name called
a King of Kings and a Lord of Lords. Alleluia. Amen.</i>'</p>

<p>Subdued awe; firm, proud confidence in a mighty, beneficent
ruler; a flash of fierce remembrance of injury&mdash;all are
rendered with a power, a vividness, a picturesque strength,
that are not transcended, even if they are equalled, by
anything ever composed in the domain of choral music for
the church or the concert-room; and the greatness and
glory of 'a King of Kings and a Lord of Lords' are celebrated
in the long final portion of this gorgeous third
movement with dazzling brilliancy of effect, sustained and
augmented up to the very end.</p>

<p>The first chorus, performed before the audience of two
thousand people assembled in Bremen Cathedral on the
evening of Good Friday, 1871, reached its effect to a very
considerable extent.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It has a broad and, as it were, popular character, is
conceived simply and wrought with sincerity,' writes the
correspondent of the <i>Allgemeine Deutsche Musikzeitung</i>.'</p>

<p>The <i>Bremen Courier</i> says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'One again recognises the titanic capacity of the composer.
The work is a vocal joy-symphony, of imposing power
and exalted feeling. Praise is due to all concerned in the
performance for they have facilitated the understanding
of the composer to a large portion of the audience.'</p>

<p>The Dietrichs came from Oldenburg to hear the new work.
Circumstances prevented the attendance of Frau Schumann
and Joachim. Neither artist had returned from what had
at this period become an annual visit of each to England,
which, in Frau Schumann's case, generally extended over at
least two months, and in Joachim's occupied the six weeks
of Lent.</p>

<p>Pending Frau Schumann's return, Brahms remained among
his friends in the north, and played his D minor Concerto
at the Bremen orchestral subscription concert of April 25<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
with great success, giving pieces by Bach, Scarlatti, and
Schumann in the second part. Frau Schumann was back
in Lichtenthal early in May, and Brahms settled into his
usual lodgings there a few days before her arrival. The
present writer had the happiness of immediately following
her, and the reader interested to learn particulars of the
summer life of quiet work and simple pleasures that followed
is referred to the Recollections placed at the beginning of
our first volume. The details there given are too slight and
too personal to be appropriate in the body of the present
narrative, though they may be found to have a value of
their own for those interested in whatever throws additional
light on the true, lovable nature of Brahms.</p>

<p>It was about this time that our composer's art began
to make perceptible progress in London. No immediate
result was perceptible from the performance of the B flat
Sextet led by Joachim at a Monday Popular concert of 1867,
but from the beginning of the seventies we find Brahms'
name appearing with some regularity in London programmes.
No opportunity was lost by Frau Schumann, Joachim, or
Stockhausen for making propaganda for their friend's
music in private artistic circles. The performance of the
Requiem at Sir Henry Thompson's house in the summer
of 1871, under Stockhausen, has already been noted. Of
minor incidents of the time in this connection, the singing
of two duets from Op. 28 by Madame Viardot-Garcia and
Stockhausen at a party given by the lady in London on
June 10 may be selected for mention.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same year the call of Bernhard Scholz to Breslau
added another to the list of towns, now to increase rapidly,
year by year, in which Brahms' art came to be cultivated
with particular vigour. Scholz, who had held successive
appointments in Hanover and Berlin, had been on terms
of familiar acquaintance with the composer from an early
period of both their careers. He now found himself in a
position, as conductor of the Breslau orchestral subscription
concerts, freely to gratify his admiration of the
master's art. From this time not only were Brahms' new
orchestral works given, with few exceptions as they appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
at the Breslau subscription concerts, but any existing
deficiencies in the Brahms education of the musical public
were supplied by performances of the two Serenades and
the Pianoforte Concerto. The composer himself played
the last-named work at Breslau in 1874 and 1876, when the
orchestra was of course conducted by Scholz. No less
attention was devoted to the chamber music. At the
concerts of the resident string quartet-party arranged by
Concertmeister Richard Himmelstoss, at which Scholz or
Julius Buths often assisted as pianist, the two Sextets, the
Quartets and Quintet, and later works in their turn, were
frequently heard, and to the successful results of these
efforts, to the warm response they elicited from the musical
circles of Breslau, we owe the composition of a genial and
now favourite work of our master, the Academic Festival
Overture, the appearance of which will be noted in its place.</p>

<p>Amongst the friends who visited Lichtenthal during the
summer of 1871 were Allgeyer, Levi, and Stockhausen, and
on September 8 the 'Song of Destiny,' completed in May,
was rehearsed at Carlsruhe.</p>

<p>'Hyperion's Schicksalslied,' by Friedrich H&ouml;lderlin (1770-1834),
sets forth the serene, passionless, unchanging existence
of the celestials, surrounded by the clear light of eternity;
and its contrast, the ever-shifting, suffering life of humanity,
wrapped in the darkness of inscrutable mystery. The poem
is entirely fatalistic, containing no comment on what it
depicts.</p>

<p class="lyrics">
'Ye wander above in light<br />
On tender soil, blessed immortals!<br />
Glistening divine breezes<br />
Touch you gently,<br />
As the fingers of the artist<br />
Sacred strings.
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
'Calm as the sleeping child<br />
Breathe the celestials;<br />
Chastely guarded<br />
In modest bud,<br />
Their spirits bloom eternally,<br />
And their blissful eyes<br />
Gaze in quiet, eternal stillness.</p>
<p class="lyrics">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
'But to us it is given<br />
On no spot to rest;<br />
Suffering men<br />
Vanish, blindly fall<br />
From hour to hour,<br />
As water thrown<br />
From rock to rock,<br />
Year-long down into uncertainty.'
</p>

<p>In Brahms' setting we have yet another fine choral work,
characteristic from every point of view, musical, &aelig;sthetic,
and psychological&mdash;one, moreover, which is of quite peculiar
interest and value, since it contains an express confession of
that creed of love to which the present writer has several times
referred as being traceable throughout the composer's life and
works. The contrasted pictures of celestial and human existence
are set with the vivid force which we have noticed in
our brief studies of preceding works, the pathos and tragedy
surrounding the lot of mankind being treated with the deep,
passionate feeling which is invariably displayed by the composer
when he is occupied with this or kindred subjects.
Brahms' 'Song of Destiny' does not, however, terminate
with H&ouml;lderlin's, nor could it have done so. Another passion
lived stronger within him than that with which he contemplated
the phenomena of human suffering, uncertainty, and
death; and he has known how to supplement his text with
a short, but most exquisitely conceived, orchestral postlude,
which, whilst it rounds the work musically into a whole,
brings to the despairing soul a message of consolation, hope,
faith, courage, such as it is within the peculiar province of
music to convey, and which has the more power over the
heart since it cannot be translated into articulate words.</p>

<p>That Brahms actually had some such intention in adding
the postlude is in the personal knowledge of the present
writer. He regarded it as not merely accessory, but as being,
in a sense, the most important part of his composition. In
rehearsing the work, it was over this portion that he lingered
with peculiar care; and when conducting its performance
he obtained from the postlude some of his rarest and most
exquisite effects of ethereal tenderness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The work was performed for the first time from the manuscript
on October 18, 1871, under the composer's direction,
at a concert of the Carlsruhe Philharmonic Society. The
overture and garden-scene from Schumann's 'Faust'
headed, and the conclusion of the second part&mdash;both under
Levi's direction&mdash;closed the programme, which further
included two of Schubert's songs. Fr&auml;ulein Johanna
Schwarz and Stockhausen were the soloists of the occasion.</p>

<p>The impression made by the new work upon the audience
of Carlsruhe was profound, and the composer returned to
Vienna gratified and pleased by an immediate success which
the experiences of his career had by no means led him to
regard as a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>The Schicksalslied was published by Simrock in December,
and was performed early in 1872 in Bremen, Breslau, Frankfurt,
and Vienna.</p>

<p>The only other original publications of 1871, the two
books of Songs, Op. 57 and 58, were issued by Rieter-Biedermann.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
All the texts of Op. 57 are original poems or
imitations (Nos. 2, 3, 7) by G. F. Daumer, whose texts are
amongst the most passionate of those set by Brahms. The
composer seems to have imagined a portrait of the poet more
or less in correspondence with his verses, and Claus Groth
tells an amusing story of the shock sustained by Brahms on
taking the opportunity of a visit to Munich to call on
Daumer.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I loaded myself with all the books of my songs that
contain something of his. I found him at last, in an out-of-the-way
house, in an out-of-the-way street, and was shown
to equally retired apartments. There in a quiet room I
found my poet. Ah, he was a little dried-up old man!
After my sincerely respectful address, on presenting my
music, the old gentleman replied with an embarrassed word
of thanks and I soon perceived that he knew nothing either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>of me or my compositions, or anything at all of music. And
when I pointed to his ardent, passionate verses, he signed
me, with a tender wave of the hand, to a little old mother
almost more withered than himself, saying, "Ah, I have
only loved the one, my wife!"'</p>

<p>The opening of the year 1872 marks the beginning of a new
period, not in the artistic, but in the private life of Brahms.
It found him installed in the historic rooms in the third story
of No. 4, Carlsgasse, Vienna, which were to remain to the
end of his life the nearest approach to an establishment of
his own to which he committed himself. He had lodged
in Novaragasse, Singerstrasse, Poststrasse 6, Wohlzeile 23,
Ungargasse 2, had stayed with his friends the Fabers&mdash;had,
in fact, since his first visit to Vienna, changed his residence
at least with each new season. When he took possession of
his rooms in Carlsgasse 4 on December 27, 1871, he had
moved for the last time. Here he lived for a little more than
a quarter of a century, here he died. He continued as he
began, a lodger in furnished apartments, renting his Carlsgasse
rooms in the first instance from a Frau Vogel, who,
with her husband and family, occupied the rest of the
dwelling. Brahms' accommodation consisted of three small
rooms communicating one with the other. The middle and
largest contained his grand piano and writing-table, a small
square-shaped instrument to which a tradition was attached,
and a table and chairs arranged, German fashion, in front of a
sofa. Here he received his visitors. In a smaller room were
his bookshelves and a high desk for standing to write.
There were cupboards for his music, which in time overflowed
into the rooms as he required more space for his collections
of original manuscripts, engravings, photographs, etc. A
few engravings adorned the walls, and his little bust of
Beethoven reminded him pleasantly of the old home in the
Fuhlentwiethe. Frau Vogel was responsible only for his
mending, for the cleaning and dusting of his rooms, and for
opening the house-door to visitors. He took his early dinner
at a restaurant&mdash;the 'Kronprinz,' the 'Goldspinnerin,' the
'Zur sch&ouml;nen Laterne,' and, for about the last fourteen years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of his life, at the 'Zum rothen Igel,' in the Wildpret Markt&mdash;and
read the newspapers afterwards over a cup of black coffee
at one of the coffee-houses, in his latter years generally the
Caf&eacute; Stadtpark. He supped either at home, with a book
for company&mdash;when his fare usually consisted of bread-and-butter
and sausage, with a glass of beer or light wine&mdash;or
again at a restaurant, when, as at dinner, he liked to be
joined by his intimates. Needless to say, the private hospitality
of friends was abundantly at his command whenever
he chose to avail himself of it.</p>

<p>The second performance of the Song of Destiny&mdash;the
first since publication&mdash;took place at the Gesellschaft concert
of January 21, under the direction of Anton Rubinstein, who
held the post of 'artistic director' of the society during the
season 1870-71, succeeding Herbeck on his appointment as
capellmeister of the imperial opera.</p>

<p>The gratification which must have been felt by the composer
at the exceptional impression created by his work on
his Austrian public was to be clouded a few days later by
news of his father's grave illness. Jakob had been ailing for
a year past, and had been obliged to resign his post at the
Philharmonic, together with smaller engagements, and
accustom himself to the sight of his beloved double-bass
standing mute in a corner of his parlour. Johannes, perceiving
that advancing years were beginning to tell on his
father, had prescribed a change of residence from the fourth
story of 1, Anscharplatz to a first-floor flat in the same street,
but the failure of strength had not been recognised as serious.
Jakob did not complain of any particular symptoms, and it
was only on the occasion of his fetching the doctor to his
stepson Fritz Schnack, who had been brought home ill from
St. Petersburg, that he bethought himself to ask advice on
his own account, when his alarming condition became
immediately apparent to the physician. Johannes, who
was immediately sent for, was on the spot without delay,
and spent the next fortnight at the bedside of the stricken
man, whom he watched with tenderest care and tried to
cheer with loving encouragement. But the end was near.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Jakob was in the grip of a fatal malady which had ravaged
his constitution continuously during the past twelve months,
though his sufferings were neither acute nor prolonged. He
died on February 11, in his sixty-sixth year, from cancer
of the liver, in the presence of his wife and two sons, and an
estrangement of some duration between Johannes and the
less energetic Fritz&mdash;returned from two years' absence in
Venezuela&mdash;was healed at his death-bed. The son's grief,
as may be expected from all that we have related of his
clinging family affection, was profound. His consolation
was found in endeavours for the protection and comfort of
the woman who had brought contentment to the closing
years of Jakob's life, and he stayed on with Frau Caroline
after the funeral, helping her to make necessary arrangements
and to look through his father's little possessions.
The old indentures of apprenticeship, the document of
citizenship, memorials of Jakob's early struggles and modest
personal successes, passed into the composer's keeping. A
small portrait in oils, of little value as a picture, but bearing
evidence of having been a good likeness of Jakob in his early
manhood, was left with the widow. 'Mother,' said Johannes
excitedly the day before his departure from Hamburg,
turning suddenly to Frau Caroline after standing for some
minutes in silence before the painting, 'as long as you live,
this of course is yours, but promise that at your death it
shall come to me in Vienna!' The promise, readily given,
was destined to remain unfulfilled. Frau Caroline, her stepson's
senior by more than six years, was to outlive him.</p>

<p>Brahms' care for his father's widow did not cease with his
return to his occupations in Vienna. When Fritz Schnack
was convalescent, and the year sufficiently advanced for
change of air to be desirable, he was sent with his mother to
Pinneberg, a pleasant country town of Holstein in great
repute with the citizens of Hamburg on account of its health-giving
climate. The visit proved so beneficial that Johannes
decided to settle his stepbrother there permanently to carry
on the business of a watch and clock maker, which he had
hitherto followed in St. Petersburg. He established him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
in a pleasant shop, providing him with all the requisites for
a new start, and wished to guarantee a comfortable home
for Frau Caroline as mistress of her son's modest household;
but the bright, energetic widow did not like the idea of relinquishing
her own activity. It was settled, therefore, that
she should return to Hamburg and to her business of taking
boarders in the first-floor flat in the Anscharplatz, on the
condition, rigorously extorted by Johannes, that she was to
draw upon him in all cases of need for herself or her son.
Brahms was wont to complain to his stepmother in after-years
that she did not sufficiently fulfil her part of the
bargain, to scold her because she did not ask for money,
and to propose and insist on holiday journeys for herself
and Fritz; and from the day of his father's death to that of
his own the kind, capable housewife continued to be the
representative to the great tone-poet of the simple, restful
tie of family affection to which he clung from beginning to
end of his career.</p>

<p>Elise Brahms was supported by her brother until her
marriage, some time later than our present date, with a
watchmaker named Grund, a widower with a family, and
was the recipient of his generosity until her death in 1892.
Fritz, 'the wrong Brahms,' as he was sometimes called, by
way of distinguishing him from Johannes, gained a good
position in Hamburg as a private teacher of the pianoforte,
and was for some years on the staff of visiting teachers at
Fr&auml;ulein Homann's ladies' school at Hamm&mdash;an establishment
which enjoyed distinguished English as well as German
patronage. He had only so far followed in his brother's
footsteps as to have been the pupil successively of Cossel and
Marxsen, and to have made a few public appearances in
Hamburg as pianist in his own Trio concerts. His talents
might have carried him farther if he had been more active
and ambitious. 'Is this your pianoforte-teacher's pace?'
demanded Johannes sharply on one of his visits to Hamburg,
as he was striding along the street in front of his brother,
who could not or would not keep up with him. Fritz was a
favourite with his friends; he possessed his share of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
family humour, and was never known to brag. 'How is
your great brother?' an acquaintance asked him one day.
'What do you mean?' retorted Fritz, who was tall and thin;
'I am bigger than he is!' He died unmarried in Hamburg
in 1886, at the age of fifty-one.</p>

<p>Preliminary arrangements were made in good time for
the performance of the completed Triumphlied at the
Rhine Festival of 1872, held in D&uuml;sseldorf; but as the
date drew near the committee strangely refused to invite
the composer to conduct his work, and Brahms therefore
withheld the manuscript. It was performed for the first
time on June 5 at a farewell concert arranged by the Grand-Ducal
Orchestra and the Philharmonic Society of Carlsruhe
jointly, for their departing conductor Hermann Levi, who
had been called to the post of court capellmeister at
Munich, which he held with brilliant success until failing
health compelled his retirement in 1896. Both Frau
Schumann and Stockhausen contributed to the programme
of the concert, Stockhausen, as a matter of course, singing
the short solo of the Triumphlied. The performance seems
to have been a fine one, though the chorus at command only
numbered 150 members. An enthusiastic account of the
work sent from Carlsruhe to the <i>Allgemeine Musikzeitung</i>
by Franz Gehring concludes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'We Germans may feel proud that such an artist has been
inspired by the impression of the most momentous events
to which our history can point, to the composition of such a
triumph-song. To the year 1870 attaches, not only the
renown of our arms, but a new epoch of our musical art....
It is based upon the modern development of long familiar
forms and modes of expression. That this development
has shown itself to be true and healthy (who had not foreseen
it in Brahms' German Requiem!) is the merit of the
German master Brahms, the greatest of the present day!'</p>

<p>Comparatively few musicians will be found in these days
to deny that Gehring's words were justified by the development
of Brahms' own career, though it cannot be concealed
that a new epoch such as that to which the reviewer looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
forward seems to have closed for the present with the
master's death.</p>

<p>Contrary to Brahms' established custom, he accepted a
concert-engagement in the course of the summer, and
appeared with immense success at the Baden-Baden Kursaal
subscription concert of August 29 as composer, conductor,
and pianist, with his own A major Serenade and Schumann's
Pianoforte Concerto. Amongst the visitors to Lichtenthal
in the course of the season was Reinthaler, who had been
present at the performance of the Triumphlied at Carlsruhe,
and returned later to spend a short holiday near his friends.</p>

<p>With the beginning of autumn, 1872, a period of ten
years had elapsed since Brahms' first visit to Vienna, and it
will help the reader to obtain a clear view of the development
of his career as a composer if we pause for a moment at this
point, to consider what had been its special features during
the decade in the course of which he had gradually come to
regard Vienna as his home. We shall find that it had been
entirely logical and continuous, and singularly independent
of those influences of his changed environment to which
imaginary effects on his art and temperament have not
seldom been attributed.</p>

<p>We observe, in the first place, that only one solo has been
added to the long list of important works for the pianoforte,
accompanied and unaccompanied, which Brahms carried
with him to Vienna in 1862, and of this one it must be said that
the Paganini studies in two books, immensely brilliant and
ingenious though they be, cannot be seriously regarded from
the musical standpoint of the Handel or other preceding
sets of variations, but must be accepted more or less as
diversions of the composer's leisure hours. Several of the
variations are little more than transcriptions for the piano
of some of those written by Paganini on the same theme for
the violin.</p>

<p>In the domain of chamber music, where, so far as it is
yet possible to anticipate the verdict of posterity, Brahms'
place will be found amongst the greatest composers of all
periods, we find that his first series of masterpieces for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
pianoforte and strings has been brought to a close with the
addition of two works&mdash;the Horn Trio performed in the
autumn of 1865, and the Sonata in E minor for pianoforte
and violoncello, whilst by the side of the String Sextet in
B flat has been placed another in G major, not indeed transcending,
but different from, and in every way worthy of, its
companion. With the enumeration of these published
works must be associated the mention of two others of
peculiar interest in our survey because they mark a fresh
stage of Brahms' matured development. The two String
Quartets in C minor and A minor were kept in the composer's
desk for some years before they were finally completed.
The significance of their appearance, which we
shall have to note in 1873, as landmarks in Brahms' career, is
best illustrated by the remembrance that twenty years had
elapsed since the fastidious self-criticism of the young
musician of twenty had caused the withdrawal of a string
quartet from the list of works proposed by Schumann for
the consideration of the publishers.</p>

<p>Brahms' fertility as a song-writer for a single voice was
constant, though it matured and varied in its manifestations
with the onward progress of his life. We have already referred
to some of the phases of its long middle period. The
decade we are considering witnessed the publication of eight
books of miscellaneous songs and three books of the Magelone
Romances.</p>

<p>In the Liebeslieder, waltzes for pianoforte duet and vocal
quartet, we have the riper artistic fruition of the mood which
produced the vocal quartets, Op. 31, 'Alternative Dance
Song,' 'Raillery,' and 'The Walk to the Beloved,' composed
at Detmold; and to the same early period the Waltzes
for pianoforte duet dedicated to Hanslick primarily belong.</p>

<p>The splendid achievement, however, which pre-eminently
distinguishes this portion of Brahms' career is to be found
in another domain: that in which we may now, in 1872,
contemplate the literal fulfilment of Schumann's much
discussed prophecy; that in which 'the masses of chorus
and orchestra <i>have</i> lent him their powers.' The composer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
has most truly 'sunk his magic staff and revealed to us
wondrous glimpses of the spirit world.' The period which
produced the German Requiem, the Song of Destiny,
and the Song of Triumph (1866-1871) could hardly be
surpassed in the brilliancy of its own special branch of
achievement, and with the completion of the last of these
works the growth of Brahms' powers upon this particular
line of development had reached its summit. The choral
works in which the master hand of the great composer
was to be again revealed, whilst they afford additional
opportunities of enjoyment to the lovers of his art, could
not, from the nature of those that had preceded them,
increase the lustre of his fame.</p>

<p>Of works for orchestra alone the two Serenades published
in 1860 are still the only examples. As we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Brahms, in the summer of 1862, showed Dietrich the first
movement of the C minor Symphony, 'which appeared,
greatly altered, much later on,'<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but since then the composer's
invariable answer to his friend's inquiries had been
that the time for a symphony had not yet arrived. The
ten years we are considering are, in fact, characteristic of
the composer as well by their silence as by their song.
We cannot doubt that just as his choral works were the
ultimate outcome of a long period of retirement and study,
of which we have traced the early as well as the late results,
so the period of his symphonic achievement was being
gradually prepared for by special work as fundamental and
unwearied. Of this we shall very soon have to note the
perfected first-fruits on the appearance of a short orchestral
composition, now amongst the most familiar and valued
of the treasures with which Brahms has enriched the
musical world.</p>

<p>Brahms returned to Vienna for the concert-season of 1872-73
with a new and absorbing interest before him. He had
accepted the appointment of 'artistic director' to the
Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, thereby undertaking the
duties of conductor, not only of the society's concerts, but
of the bi-weekly practices of its choral society. The usual
scheme of the Gesellschaft concert-season, extending from
about the middle of November to April, comprised four
regular, and two extra, concerts with orchestra and chorus,
one at least of which was devoted to an oratorio or other
great choral work.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms will now conduct the Gesellschaft concerts,'
writes Billroth on October 25; 'he is preparing Handel's
<i>Te Deum</i> and "Saul," two Bach cantatas, his "Triumphlied,"
etc. At present he is all enthusiasm over the direction
of the choral society, and enraptured with the voices and
the musical talent of the choir. Should the results be favourable,
he will, I think, persevere; a failure might suffice to
discourage him so much as to deprive him of all inclination
for the work....'</p>

<p>The season opened on November 10 with the following
programme:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>This selection hardly invited an enthusiastic demonstration
from a mixed audience, but the performances were well
received, and the occasion resulted in a substantial artistic
success for Brahms, and in the removal of the doubt which
had been entertained, even in some friendly quarters, as to
his fitness for his new duties. The inclusion of the so-called
symphony by Schubert was mentioned with disapproval by
some of the papers, though the masterly instrumentation of
Joachim's arrangement&mdash;made, we may add, at Schumann's
suggestion&mdash;was duly acknowledged.</p>

<p>The second concert, the first 'extra' of the season, was
in every respect brilliant. It included the second performance
of the complete Triumphlied, published shortly before
by Simrock with Brahms' dedication to His Majesty the
Emperor William I. The original title inscribed on the
manuscript of the work&mdash;'Song of Triumph on the Victory
of German Arms'&mdash;was shortened on publication to the
simple 'Song of Triumph.' The programme of December 6
was as follows:</p>

new instrument, which had been inaugurated at the previous
concert by Bibl; the singing of Gluck's aria by Frau
Joachim; the rendering of two choral works, both new to
the audience, the productions of two masters each representative
of his day, with the art history of a century lying
between them, combined to make a programme of peculiar
and varied interest. The Offertorium, an unpublished
work composed by Mozart in his twenty-first year, was
written for double chorus and organ, to which the composer
afterwards added two violins. Brahms now availed himself
for the support of his voices of the entire string band, and
the performance of the beautiful and unfamiliar work made
a great impression. It was published almost immediately
by J. P. Gotthard of Vienna. The most important event of
the concert was, of course, the first performance in Vienna
of the performer's Song of Triumph.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'A truly magnificent work, which produced a profound
and enduring impression,' says Schelle; 'the German
victories have been the occasion of its composition....
Both as regards its form and its treatment of masses, this
work bears the stamp of a masterpiece. The performances
were excellent. The society's concerts could certainly be
in no better hands.'</p>

<p>The Triumphlied was given a week later, December 14,
in Munich, under Franz W&uuml;llner, and was again reviewed at
length in the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> of the 25th in a highly
interesting article by Franz Pyllemann.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The orchestra develops truly royal splendour.... What
wealth of tone-combination, what intoxicating charm of
colouring, strike the ear of the listener! The knowledge
shown in the use and application of the most appropriate
and noble means of expression, as offered by the various
instruments, must be noted with deep admiration. Brahms'
mastery in the handling of chorus has long been common
knowledge. He makes great demands on his singers, and
does not readily restrict the development of an artistic idea
on account either of their convenience or their uncertainty.
But, how his choral movements sound! In this respect,
the master stands nearer to the heroes of choral composition,
and especially Handel, than any other modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>musician. He has studied their works; he has most intimately
fused their, for our time, almost enigmatical technique
with the many resources of modern art; so that we
might often suppose ourselves to be listening, as regards his
thematic work, the polyphonic construction of his parts, to a
masterpiece of the eighteenth century, whilst the character
of the themes, the quality of the harmonies, the condition
of the form, on the whole and in detail, are entirely modern,
are quite specifically "Brahms."'</p>

<p>The work was given at the Gewandhaus Concerts, Leipzig,
on February 27, 1873.</p>

<p>The effect of the second 'regular' Gesellschaft concert of
the season, on January 5, 1873, was marred by a series of
misfortunes. Three works were announced for performance:</p>

<table border="0" style="width:90%;" summary="Programme of January 5.">
  <tr>
    <td style="width:30%;">1. Hiller:</td>
    <td>Concert Overture in D major.</td>

    <td>'Des S&auml;ngers Fluch.'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Mendelssohn:</td>
    <td>'Die Walpurgis Nacht.'</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Hiller, who happened to be staying in Vienna, had promised
to conduct his overture to 'Demetrius,' the most successful
of his four works in this form, but, owing to an accident to
the music, it was necessary to substitute another, which
proved ineffective. The drummer was attacked by sudden
illness on the day of the concert, and the substitute provided
proved unequal to the emergency; Hiller was obliged to rap
for silence immediately after beginning the performance of
his work, and to recommence. A similar mishap attended
the course of the 'S&auml;ngers Fluch,' under Brahms' direction,
in consequence of a misunderstanding between the solo
vocalists and the harpists. Mendelssohn's work alone went
without a blemish.</p>

<p>A very great success was obtained at the next concert,
on February 28, the second 'extra' of the season, with
Handel's oratorio 'Saul,' given for the first time in Vienna.
The great work was received with enthusiasm, and the
performance pronounced perfect both by public and
press.</p>

<p>This was followed, at the next 'regular' concert on
March 23, by a varied programme:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<table border="0" style="width:90%;" summary="Programme of March 23">

    <td>Easter Cantata, 'Christ lag in Todesbanden.'</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Chorus from 'Die Weihe des Hauses,' for Soprano solo, Chorus, and Orchestra.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The attitude of the audience during the early part of this
concert was somewhat doubtful, the opening cantata being
followed with earnestness, but with scanty demonstrations
of approval. At the entry of the chorale at the close of the
work, however, an electric feeling passed through the packed
hall as at the release from strained attention, and the
applause which followed was loud and resounding.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It is hardly possible to bestow enough praise upon the
performance of the cantata,' says Schelle (the <i>Presse</i>); 'the
choral society and their conductor Brahms acquitted themselves
most splendidly of their task, and warm acknowledgment
is also due to Herr Organist Bibl.'</p>

<p>Similar praise is given to the performance of the other
numbers of the programme, special mention being made of
the folk-songs, one of which had to be repeated.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'In a word,' concludes the critic, 'the satisfaction caused
us by the beautifully arranged concert must, we think, have
been equalled by that felt by Brahms at its success.'</p>

<p>Billroth gives an interesting account, in a letter dated
March 29, of the energy and success of Brahms' work in this
new field of labour.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms is extremely active as a conductor; he has
achieved incomparably fine performances, and receives the
fullest recognition from all who take art earnestly. His
"Triumphlied," given with organ and an immense chorus,
produced a marvellous effect here; great masses are required
for its performance, it is monumental music....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'At the last concert Brahms ventured upon one of the
most difficult of Bach's cantatas, composed to Luther's
text, "Christ lay in bonds of death," which had never before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>been performed. The Viennese accepted this with amiability
from such a favourite as Brahms. Two unaccompanied
folk-songs which came next ("In stiller Nacht" and
"Der sch&ouml;nste Bursch am ganzen Rhein") awakened such
a storm of applause, however, that one almost felt afraid
the house would fall in. The old King of Hanover was
almost beside himself with musical intoxication. One
becomes quite drunk with the beautiful quality of sound
produced by this choir, whose increase and decrease (<i>f.</i> and <i>p.</i>)
are carried on like those of one voice....'</p>

<p>Sufficient detail has now been given of the Gesellschaft
concert-season of 1872-73 to show the wisdom of the
committee in their choice of a new 'artistic director,' and it
only remains to mention the advertised 'last' concert
of April 6. Two works were brought to a hearing:</p>

<table border="0" style="width:90%;" summary="">
  <tr>
    <td style="width:30%;">1. Bach:</td>
    <td>Cantata, 'Liebster Gott, wann werd' ich sterben.'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Cherubini:</td>
    <td>Requiem in C minor.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The success of the performances may be inferred from the
fact that the programme was repeated two days later at an
additional concert hastily arranged to fulfil the general
demand for an encore.</p>

<p>Brahms was singularly unfortunate this year in his efforts
to secure a quiet retreat for the pursuit of his usual summer
avocations. Flying, after two days' residence in lodgings
in Gratwein, Styria, from the attentions of some '&aelig;sthetic
ladies' who began to threaten his peace, he took refuge in
the attic of the 'Seerose,' an inn in the Bavarian village of
Tutzing, on Lake Starnberg, to receive, the very night of his
arrival, a formal written invitation to make one, during his
stay, of a light-hearted fellowship of youthful authors,
painters, and musicians who held their meetings in the house.
An early hour of the morning witnessed his second abrupt
departure, the only answer vouchsafed to the missive being
its torn fragments scattered on the floor of his room. He
took refuge this time with Levi at Munich, and made his
headquarters at his friend's house during the early part of
the summer, seeing much also of Allgeyer, who had been
invited to settle professionally in the Bavarian capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
shortly after Levi's departure from Carlsruhe. Later on
Brahms attended the Schumann Festival at Bonn
(August 17-19), arranged, by Joachim's suggestion, for the
purpose of assisting a fund for the erection of a memorial
to Schumann in the city where the master had passed the
two last sad years of his life, and where a Beethoven monument
had been unveiled in 1871. There were orchestral
concerts on the 17th and 18th, both conducted by Joachim,
excepting in the case of one work (Wasielewsky), and a
matin&eacute;e of chamber music on the 19th, the programmes, in
which Frau Schumann, Frau Joachim, Stockhausen, and
others took part, being entirely selected from Schumann's
works. The festival closed with a social function, an excursion
by steamer to Rolandseck. The presence at Bonn of
each member of the remarkable quartet of great musicians,
whom we have seen closely bound together by ties of artistic
and personal friendship through nearly twenty years, was
made the more interesting by the addition of Ferdinand
Hiller, the intimate ally of all four. Many other old friends
were there, of whom Freiherr von Meysenbug, as reviving
Detmold memories, should be particularly mentioned.
Brahms made some new acquaintances also, notably Professor
Engelmann and his gifted wife, known in the musical
world for a few seasons as the pianist Fr&auml;ulein Emma Brandes,
who retired from a public career on her early marriage.</p>

<p>Brahms, though taking no active part in the concerts,
was not at all averse to contributing to the private artistic
pleasures of the week. The most memorable of these was
the first introduction to a few of his friends of the Variations
on a theme by Haydn, which he played with Frau Schumann
in the version of the work for two pianofortes. Another
day he turned into a pianoforte warehouse in the course of
a walk with Wasielewsky, and sitting down before one of
the instruments extemporized one waltz after another.</p>

<p>After leaving Bonn he paid his annual visit to Lichtenthal,
where Frau Schumann and her daughters also stayed for a
few weeks, though it was no longer their place of residence.
They moved this year to Berlin, and in future only visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Baden-Baden for occasional change. Brahms sometimes
met his old friends there in the summer until the year
1878, when Frau Schumann accepted an appointment at
the Conservatoire of Music founded by Dr. Hoch at
Frankfurt. She then sold her house at Lichtenthal, and
Brahms' subsequent association with the neighbourhood
was limited to rare visits of a few days. Frau Schumann
continued to live at Frankfurt from this time, though she
resigned her duties at the conservatoire some years before
her death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Brahms spent several weeks of this and
succeeding summers at his old lodgings, and one day in
August of this year he played the finally completed String
Quartets in C minor and A minor, and the 'Rain-songs' to
Frau Schumann. She had heard the C minor Quartet, as
the reader may remember, in the summer of 1866. The
composer played both works to Dr. Hermann Deiters when
he was staying at Bonn in 1868.</p>

<p>Claus Groth's poem 'Rain-song' and the shorter one
'Echo,' which form the texts of Nos. 3 and 4 of Brahms'
Op. 59, were particular favourites of our master. He
composed the 'Nachklang,' of which he chose the title,
twice. The published version is the second of the two.
Musical readers will remember that melody and accompaniment
are used again in the duet Sonata in G major.</p>

<p>Both String Quartets were performed privately in Berlin
by Joachim and his colleagues. They were played for the
first time in public; that in A minor in Berlin at the
Joachim Quartet concert of October 18 from the manuscript;
that in C minor at the Hellmesberger concert of December 11
in Vienna from the printed copies.</p>

<span class="caption">BRAHMS AT THE AGE OF 40.</span>
</div>

<p>The appearance of these two works as Op. 51, Nos. 1 and 2,
forms, as we have said, another and important landmark
in the development of Brahms' career. The String Quartet
holds a position of peculiar significance in the art of music,
and a composer, by selecting this form for the exercise of
his powers, exposes them to the most unfailing test to which
his calibre as a musician can possibly be submitted. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>must possess not only fertility in the production of purely
musical concentrated ideas, and ideas capable of development;
the power to develop them, which means many things,
and the capacity for shaping them into clear structure;
but he must be able to express them with the most bare
and simple musical means, with four strings. From the
rapid effects of strong and strongly contrasted sensation
producible by the pianoforte, or the varied tone-colour of
the orchestra, he is precluded. With his four strings he
can interest, delight, touch, but hardly astonish his hearers.
The String Quartet is absolute music in its purest form,
and but few works in this domain can survive their birth
unless they be destined to attain a long life. The means
are perfect for the end, but this is difficult of achievement;
only the quartet of a master has much chance of being heard
after its first few performances. It will be evident to the
reader that Brahms was fitted by many essential characteristics
of his genius for success in this branch of art, though
it cannot cause surprise that one of his great qualities, the
power of waiting for results, should have strengthened his
fastidiousness in accepting as final the fruits of his studies
in a form which had been brought to ideal perfection by
Haydn and Beethoven, each in their day. On the great
musicianship manifest in Brahms' quartets, on his mastery
over his means, his power of completely balancing his four
parts, of making each a separate individuality whilst all
blend harmoniously as equal constituents of an organic
whole, it is only necessary to insist here in so far as these
qualities are elements in another feature which pre-eminently
marks our master's chamber music for strings:
the extraordinary beauty of its structure. Throughout the
three quartets and two quintets for strings composed by
Brahms there is not only no mere passage writing, but it
would be difficult to point to a single note that could be
called superfluous. Each seems to have been placed with
loving care by the master hand of the great musical architect,
the artist builder, as an essential part of the whole large
design. When we examine the thoughts themselves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
their development we find that we are, as in all Brahms'
works, in the presence of a powerful and fascinating individuality.
Ideas and treatment are the master's own, not
easy at once to understand, but offering almost inexhaustible
opportunity for discovery and enjoyment to listeners
willing to earn such rewards. The two quartets, Op. 51,
are more or less severally representative of contrasted
sides of Brahms' individuality. The first, in C minor, is
generally characterized by fire and impetuosity, exquisitely
relieved by the tender romance of the second movement;
No. 2, in A minor, is conceived in a softer vein. The last
movement of this work contains a beautiful example of
the characteristic Brahms coda; the augmented vigour of
the climax is preceded by a period of tranquillity that
seems to place the listener in an atmosphere of mystic
exaltation, to afford him 'glimpses of a spirit world' from
which the previous thoughts of the movement flow towards
him in transfigured tones. Lovers of the master's music
will recall a similar feature in other works. In the opening
theme of the first movement, which is suggestive of
Joachim's early device F.A.E.&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>we may, perhaps, perceive a passing reference to the remembrance
of his friend which must certainly have been present
to Brahms' mind as he planned these works. Instances of
the composer's mastery of the art of modulation, of his
boldness and facility in going to, and returning from
unexpected and distant keys, may be found in the two
quartets as in the majority of his instrumental compositions.
They were dedicated by Brahms to 'his friend Dr. Theodor
Billroth of Vienna,' and were published in the autumn by
Simrock.</p>

<p>Amongst those who had looked forward with particular
expectancy to the opening of the great World Exhibition
that was held in Vienna in the autumn of 1873 was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
painter Anselm Feuerbach. He had, the previous year,
accepted the offer of an appointment as director of the
historical class about to be formed in the Imperial Academy
of Plastic Arts of that city, but had begged for a year's
leave of absence in Rome before entering on his new duties,
in order that he might finish two great pictures, 'The
Battle of the Amazons' and 'The Second Symposium,'
the exhibition of which he conceived likely to establish his
fame and to secure him an authoritative position on taking
up his residence in Austria. The nearly finished pictures
were sent to Vienna in March or April, and Feuerbach
followed them in May, 1873, but it turned out that they
could not be hung in the Exhibition gallery on account of
their great size. The painter determined, therefore, to
exhibit them one after the other in the 'K&uuml;nstler-Haus,'
and, in order to secure the advantage of association in the
mind of the public with so favourite a celebrity of Vienna
as Brahms had at this time become, he requested the master
to sit to him on his return in October in order that his
portrait might be exhibited with the other pictures.</p>

<p>Feuerbach was a small man of ultra-refined appearance
and manners, and a countenance of rather melancholy
expression that had evidently been of striking beauty in his
youth. He was accustomed to be made much of by ladies,
was extremely sensitive and self-centred, and inordinately
vain, and had confidently persuaded himself that his
pictures were to achieve an instant and overwhelming
success.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'My pictures are splendid and all but finished,' he wrote
to his mother on October 2; 'why should I feel a moment's
anxiety since I have eminent power in my hands; genius
and position.... The Symposium also is quite exquisite,
I may say so now as I have seen the Vatican.'<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Brahms, who had, as we have seen, a long-standing
acquaintance with Feuerbach and sincerely admired his
powers, mounted the many flights of stairs leading to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
artist's temporary studio more than once. His attention
was particularly called to the 'Battle of the Amazons,' on
which, as it was to be exhibited first, Feuerbach was busy
with the finishing touches. He mentioned it several times
in a reserved manner to Groth, who was in Vienna for
the Exhibition, saying he was anxious to have his opinion
of it, and persuaded him to pay a visit to the studio one
day to be presented to Feuerbach. Groth, however, on
coming away, found that he was unable, as Brahms had been,
to express himself warmly about the great painting, and
merely agreed with our master in 'not understanding' it.
Brahms, intimately acquainted with the artist circles of
Vienna, evidently could not shake off his apprehension as
to the result of the exhibition, and took an opportunity of
speaking a word of warning to Feuerbach, advising him to
be cautious, and to introduce himself to his new public with
a smaller work. The integrity of the composer's ideas of
friendship and the misunderstanding of his motives which
was its frequent result, as well as the general soundness of
his judgment in matters on which he ventured to give
advice, are well illustrated by the affair. His words produced
an immediate effect very different from that intended
by him. The wound they inflicted on the irritable susceptibility
of the painter was so painful as to deprive him of
the power of concentrating his mind upon the 'Amazons'
for several subsequent days, and he found it impossible to
go on with Brahms' portrait.</p>

<p>'Another evening spoilt by Brahms,' he wrote on
November 3; and again: 'I was not for a second angry
with Brahms, but I have put his canvas aside for the
present.' It was never taken up again.</p>

<p>The pictures were duly exhibited in turn, and it may be
said that the final breakdown of Feuerbach's never robust
constitution was the ultimate result. Not criticism only or
even chiefly, but torrents of contempt, derision, insult were
poured upon his work.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'A storm broke over my head by which I could at least
reassure myself as to the importance of my pictures. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>could not sit down to table without finding jests, raillery,
caricature&mdash;unfortunately always bad&mdash;beside my plate,
and the story of my discomfiture was related in the house
from roof to cellar. I was told that everyone, from the
professor to the porter's boy, was laughing at my bad
picture.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Almost the entire press, independent and mercenary
alike, was arrayed against Feuerbach,' says Allgeyer.</p>

<p>His pupils, however, offered him the mute sympathy and
support of punctual attendance and respectful attention
at class, and the Minister remained loyal to him. He
retained his appointment till the close of 1876, though
ill-health prevented him from performing his duties during
the last half-year. He died at N&uuml;rnburg in 1880. His
friendship with our master did not terminate with the
incident of the pictures.</p>

<p>'Brahms has lent me his fur-coat for my journey,' he
wrote in February, 1875, on the eve of his departure for
Rome.</p>

<p>The 'Battle of the Amazons' was presented by the
artist's mother to the city of N&uuml;rnburg in the year 1889,
and hangs there in the picture gallery of the Town
Hall. Many of the studies for the 'Amazons' and the
'Symposium' were purchased by King Ludwig II. of
Bavaria, and presented by him to the Royal Pinakothek
at Munich.</p>

<p>Of the many letters of congratulation received by Allgeyer
after the appearance of his 'Life of Feuerbach' in 1894, one
of those most highly prized by him came from Brahms.</p>

<p>Brahms paid one visit to the great Exhibition in the
company of Groth and other friends, though the noise and
bustle of such a scene were by no means to his taste. He
was more anxious that his friend should see and hear what
was really characteristic of Vienna. 'You must go to the
Volksgarten on Friday evening when Johann Strauss will
conduct his waltzes. <i>There</i> is a master; such a master of
the orchestra that one never loses a single tone of whatever
instrument!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Having promised to arrange a meeting between Frau
Dustmann of the imperial opera and Groth, Brahms came
to the poet's hotel one morning, and entering the room
where he was lying in bed with a bad feverish cold, exclaimed
delightedly: 'Come to me this evening, the
Dustmann will sing to you.' 'But you see I am ill,'
returned Groth testily. 'You will be astonished,' continued
Brahms, whose boast it was that he had never in his life
been really ill, '<i>there</i> is a singer, <i>there</i> is an artist; <i>she</i> will
please you!' 'Ah, my dear fellow, I really cannot come,'
pleaded the other, 'Johann has just put a cold compress on,
I am so miserable!' 'She is very seldom free just now;
she cannot come another day.' 'Surely you see how
miserable I am. How I should like to come, but I cannot,'
persisted Groth. Then Brahms turned to go. 'You are
a Philistine!' he declared angrily as he left the room.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The ante-Christmas season of 1873, signalized on its
immediate opening by the performance of the String
Quartet in A minor at Berlin, already referred to, was
further rendered distinctive in Brahms' career by the first
performance from the manuscript of the Variations for
Orchestra on a theme by Haydn, which took place at the
Vienna Philharmonic of November 2 under Dessoff's
direction. The masterly and attractive work consists, as
most amateurs are aware, of eight variations and a finale on
the 'Chorale St. Antoni.' The composer adheres almost
entirely to Haydn's harmonies in the giving out of the theme.
The variations are constructed on the principle often observable
in his works in this form; they constitute, as it were,
a series of little movements each woven more or less appreciably
from the matter of the chorale, but each with a character
of its own and complete in itself, while the entire composition
is gathered together and rounded into a whole by the
finale. Brahms' vivid and original imagination of tone-effect
is very clearly discernible throughout the work, and
is especially illustrated in it by his original and effective
employment of the double bassoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>The variations were received by the crowded audience,
and reviewed by the press, with warm welcome and with
grateful appreciation of their beauty and perfection, if with
some trace of disappointment that he who 'held the sceptre'
in the domain of music for the chamber and the concert-room,
and must of all living musicians be pre-eminently
qualified for the composition of a symphony, should be the
very man to refrain from writing one. Brahms, however,
was well aware of the gigantic difficulty of the task that lay
before him in the writing of a symphony that should successfully
encounter that ordeal of comparison with the
greatest works of its class which had become inevitable by
the fact of his acknowledged supremacy in other forms.
The ultimate cause of his delay and the pledge of his future
victory are alike to be found in the nature of his artistic
convictions, which, holding him loyal to the traditions of
the past masters of instrumental music, made it impossible
to him to seek novelty by compromising with modern
methods. Brahms elected to wait until, with the gradual
ripening of his powers to full maturity, he should feel, not
only that he had something of his own to say in the highest
domain of pure music, but that he had mastered the power
of expressing it in a manner true to himself. Had he never
felt assured on these two points it is certain that no
symphony of his would ever have been made public, no
matter to what sum of months the hours might amount
which he had devoted to the study and practice of writing
for the orchestra. Having now given a sign of his whereabouts
he again drew a veil over the course of his artistic
development, and, appearing before the public during the
next three years only on ground which he had already made
his own, revealed no more upward stages of his achievement
until he at length stood victoriously before the world on
its summit.</p>

<p>The variations were performed for the second time on
December 10 under Levi in Munich.</p>

<p>The Gesellschaft season opened under Brahms' direction
on November 9, with Beethoven's Overture, Op. 115, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

<p>The publications of the year, all issued in the autumn,
were, in addition to the String Quartets, the version for two
Pianofortes of the Haydn Variations (Op. 56<i>b</i>), by Simrock,
and a set of eight Songs (Op. 59), by Rieter-Biedermann.
Of these, four are set to texts by Claus Groth, which include
'Rain-songs' and the lovely 'Dein blaues Auge h&auml;lt so
still.' The Variations for Orchestra were published by
Simrock in 1874.</p>

<p>Brahms was at this time quite immersed in his various
kinds of work.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I am so enormously occupied that I see my best friends
only very rarely and by accident,' he wrote in December
to the present author.</p>

<p>It had now become his custom to decline invitations for
the Christmas festival, and to spend it, partly at the open-air
Christmas market, where he made himself happy by
purchasing gifts for the poor children whom he found crowding
round the tempting wares, and partly at home, where he
would look in for half an hour at the family party gathered
in front of his landlady's Christmas-tree; no doubt contributing
his share to the surprises of Christmas Eve, the
'sacred evening' when, throughout the length and breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
of Germany and Austria, innumerable trees are lighted
up at about the same hour, and the great exchange
takes place of presents to which, in many cases, the preparation
and savings of a year have been consecrated. A
New Year's present of a special kind received by Brahms
this winter was the Maximilian Order for Art and Science
conferred on him by King Ludwig II. of Bavaria.</p>

<p>The year 1874 was unusually full of movement and varied
excitement for our composer. From January onwards he
was besieged with invitations, many of which he accepted,
to conduct his works at concerts and festivals in North
Germany, the Rhine, Switzerland, and was obliged to reply
in the negative to Dietrich's request, received in the
beginning of spring, that he would include Oldenburg in
his arrangements.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I am more than sorry, but you are too late! I
have already promised so much, and shall not be coming to
your neighbourhood!</p>

<p class="blockquot">'If you had written earlier I could have arranged with
Hanover, Bremen, etc., for, <i>seriously</i>, I should be too glad
to go to you again....'</p>

<p>The third Gesellschaft concert of the season (1873-74)
took place on January 25. That the performances under
Brahms would be above criticism had become by this time
almost a foregone conclusion, and, beyond recording the
great success achieved by Goldmark's 'Hymn of Spring,'
it is only necessary to give the programme of the occasion:</p>

<table border="0" style="width:90%;" summary="Programme of January 25">

<p>A few days later Brahms left Vienna to fulfil a group of
engagements in Leipzig, a circumstance which in itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
affords some indication of the rapid strides by which his
career had lately been advancing towards the full sunshine
of success that was to flood the latter portion of his path
through life.</p>

<p>The relations between Brahms and the city which owed
its brilliant reputation as a musical centre to Mendelssohn's
influence had been at no time really sympathetic. The
attitude of expectant toleration that had been more or less
adopted towards him by both its extreme parties after his
first visit in 1853 had resulted on the one hand from
Schumann's essay, and on the other, from the confidence
felt by the Weimarites and expressed by Liszt that his
'new paths' must eventually bring him into close touch
with themselves. Gradually, however, it, became clear how
mistaken was the belief that the young musician would
drift towards acceptance of the extreme new tendencies,
whilst the originality of his musical thoughts and of his
manner of expressing them was abhorrent to the inflexible
conservatism that had come to represent the traditions of
the Gewandhaus. If, moreover, there is every reason to
surmise that Mendelssohn himself had no hearty appreciation
of Schumann's genius, it is equally probable that neither
Rietz, who conducted the Gewandhaus concerts from 1848 to
1860, nor Reinecke, who succeeded him, was in very warm
sympathy with that of Brahms, and the predilections of the
public followed those of their accredited guides.</p>

<p>Brahms' works were, it is true, generally given at the
orchestral or chamber concerts of the Gewandhaus soon
after publication, but, excepting the Triumphlied, with its
special appeal to the patriotic sentiment of the great
German people, they met with but scanty response from
an audience little accustomed to the exertion of trying to
follow the expression of a new and original artistic individuality.
That Reinecke was by no means an ideal
conductor of them naturally resulted from the fact that by
training, by conviction, and by practice, he was attached
to a rigidly formal school of modern musical thought, and
it can surprise no one that he should have been unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
entirely to realize the deeper and richer utterances of
Schumann's young prophet. Brahms' chamber music fared
differently in the hands of David, who was almost alone
amongst the authorities of the Gewandhaus in his sympathy
for the composer's genius. To these considerations it must
be added that not only the pianist, but the composer
Rubinstein, had, as we indicated in an early chapter, an
enthusiastic following amongst the typical Leipzig public
who were disposed to resent any claim to recognition that
might threaten to rival that of their favourite.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of the fact that Brahms was no party
man, in Leipzig, as in almost every other city where his
music was heard, it struck a root, imperceptible at first,
but growing deeper and stronger and more extended with
every year that went by. The attention bestowed on it by
Brendel's society has been frequently referred to in these
pages; it was cultivated, also, by Riedel's celebrated choir.
A more representative illustration, however, of a certain
mysterious power inherent in Brahms' works of finding
their way sooner or later, and not seldom it is sooner, to the
heart, in spite of their intellectuality, their difficulty, their
reserve, is furnished by the case of two sisters, daughters
of the head of one of the great bookselling houses of Leipzig.
The Fr&auml;ulein Weigand did not live in a musical 'set,' nor
were they personally acquainted with Brahms or his friends,
but not long after their first casual introduction to his
music in the middle of the sixties, when they were young
girls, the appearance of each of his new works had come to
be an event in their lives. 'You from Leipzig!' exclaimed
Hermann Levi, with whom the sisters had a passing acquaintance
in the summer of 1871. It was not until three months
before the composer's death that these ladies had any
personal communication with him. Then, hearing of his
hopeless illness, they resolved to address him for the first
and last time, and in January, 1897, they wrote to him
telling how they had always loved his music and followed
his career. No one who really knew him will doubt the
pleasure that the letter gave to the dying master. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
answer he sent his photograph with his autograph,
'Johannes Brahms,' and the inscription, 'To the two
sisters as a little token of heart-felt thanks for their so kind
account.'</p>

<p>Of the professional critics of Leipzig, Bernsdorf of the
Signale remained to the last irreconcilable to Brahms' art;
but, on the other hand, D&ouml;rffel of the <i>Leipziger Nachrichten</i>
watched the appearance of his works with profound interest
and reviewed them with extreme sympathy and acumen.
There was during the sixties no influential 'Brahms'
community in musical Leipzig, no active 'Brahms' propaganda
in the houses of wealthy amateurs. Such occasional
admirers as the composer may have had in this circle were
to be met in the drawing-room of the lady introduced to
the reader in an early chapter as Hedwig Salamon, since
married to the composer Franz von Holstein. At the
beginning of the seventies, however, a few well-known
residents were to be found who had a strong bond of union
in their common sympathy with Brahms' genius. Of these,
in addition to the von Holsteins, may be particularly
mentioned Philipp Spitta, now remembered in all parts of
the musical world as the author of the standard Bach
Biography, Alfred Volkland, Herr Astor, of the firm
of Rieter-Biedermann, and later on its head, and the
distinguished composer Heinrich von Herzogenberg, who
settled in Leipzig in 1872 on his marriage with Elisabeth von
Stockhausen. This lady, endowed in an extraordinary
degree with beauty, goodness, intellectual and artistic gifts,
domestic qualities, and any other imaginable graces and
perfections, soon came to be numbered with her husband
amongst the ardent devotees of Brahms' art. It will be
convenient to mention here also that Theodor Kirchner
settled in Leipzig in 1875, the year in which Spitta accepted
a call to Berlin.</p>

<p>All these circumstances put together seem to explain the
master's visit to Leipzig, where he had made no public
appearance since the Gewandhaus concert of November 26,
1860, when he and Joachim had conducted each other's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Hungarian Concerto and Serenade in A major without
success. Brahms was now to conduct a performance of
'Rinaldo' at a concert of the University Choral Society at
the Gewandhaus on February 3, and the Haydn Variations,
three Hungarian Dances, and the 'Rhapsody' (solo, Frau
Joachim) at the Gewandhaus subscription concert of
February 5. His presence in Leipzig was further welcomed
by the performance of the G minor Pianoforte Quartet at the
Gewandhaus chamber concert of February 1, and by the
performance of a Brahms programme by the <i>Allgemeiner
Musikverein</i> on January 30. On January 17 one of the
string quartets had been performed at the Gewandhaus
concert by David and his party.</p>

<p>The moment when Brahms stepped on to the Gewandhaus
platform, the acknowledged representative, in at least two
domains of musical art, of the greatest masters who had
preceded him, must have been one of quiet satisfaction to
himself if he cast a thought backward to the evening,
more than thirteen years ago, when he had last appeared
in the same hall, and, not for the first time, unsuccessfully
sought the suffrages of the same public. Even now, however,
though he was received with the respect due to a
musician of his great standing, he was not to taste the
enjoyment of feeling that he had aroused the enthusiasm,
hardly that he had awakened the sympathy, of his audience.
The Gewandhaus public, rarely demonstrative, preserved
its special attitude of coldness and reserve towards him,
and though he may have enjoyed the society of his personal
friends, he was probably glad to find himself back again
in the genial atmosphere of his surroundings in Vienna,
where, in spite of the survival of a hostile attitude in certain
organs of the press, his ground had become practically his
own.</p>

<p>The Haydn Variations were performed in February or
March at Breslau (twice), Aachen and M&uuml;nster, under the
respective conductors of the subscription concerts, and on
March 13 the composer assisted, but with little success, in
the performance of a Brahms programme at an Academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
concert, Munich, under Levi, conducting the new work,
and playing the solo of the D minor Concerto. In spite of
Levi's continued efforts the musical circles of Munich
remained indifferent to the master's music. The Haydn
Variations were heard for the first time in London at the
Philharmonic concert of May 24, 1875, under W. G. Cusins.</p>

<p>The programmes performed at the two 'extra' concerts
of the Vienna Gesellschaft were: On March 2&mdash;</p>

<p>Brahms' leisure was considerably curtailed this summer.
Of the numerous engagements fulfilled by him after the close
of the Vienna concert-season three may be particularly
mentioned. He conducted the Triumphlied at the first
concert of the Rhine Festival (Cologne, May 24-27), at the
Jubilee anniversary concert of the Basle Choral Society,
and at a concert of the Z&uuml;rich Music Festival (July), and
on each occasion the great song was received with acclamation.
With this work we may, perhaps, especially associate
the honour of the Prussian Ordre pour le M&eacute;rite which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
conferred later on the composer by the Emperor William I.
He was elected an honorary member of the Royal Academy
of Arts, Berlin, in the course of the summer.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms is becoming so popular,' writes Billroth on
June 2, 'and is everywhere made so much of, that he could
easily become a rich man with his composition if he could
take it lightly. Fortunately this is not the case.'</p>

<p>The Triumphlied was performed in the German imperial
capital on December 17, 1874, under Stockhausen. It
was given under Levi at the great Bismarck Festival in
Munich, and was heard in London at a concert given in
St. James's Hall by George Henschel, December 2, 1880, for
the benefit of the Victoria Hospital for Children, Chelsea.</p>

<p>The magnificent work is now but seldom performed:
partly, no doubt, because it was composed to celebrate a
particular series of events in history, partly because of the
difficulty of securing the large chorus necessary for its due
effect, partly, perhaps, on account of the demands it makes
on the attention of the listener. Whatever be the cause,
the fact itself is to be deeply regretted. The work has
sometimes been criticised as wanting in contrast of mood.
Undoubtedly it is, from beginning to end, a song of passionate
exultation which scarcely makes pause from the first note
to the last, and the listener requires time and repeated
hearings to become familiarized with its brilliancy before
he can follow it with pleasure; but it is full of varied features
of interest to lay hearers, and especially to those who will
devote a little time to its study before listening to its
performance. To the musician it appeals as a marvel of
polyphonic art, though it contains no elaborated features
of harmonic or contrapuntal learning that might have been
prejudicial to its character as a national strain. It is
literally 'a sound of many voices saying Alleluia.'</p>

<p>The master lodged this summer near Nidelbad, above
R&uuml;schlikon on Lake Z&uuml;rich. Amongst the friends and
acquaintances old and new with whom he had intercourse
were Bargheer, Hegar, G. Eberhard, Gottfried Keller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Bernhard Hopfer, Professor and Frau Engelmann from
Utrecht, and J. V. Widmann. Brahms made Widmann's
acquaintance at this time at the house of Hermann G&ouml;tz,
and seems to have been immediately attracted by him;
partly, perhaps, because the younger man had the courage
of his opinions, and ventured to oppose him in argument.
The acquaintance, cemented during the three days of the
Z&uuml;rich Festival, grew into an intimate and lasting friendship,
to which the musical world is indebted for Widmann's
well-known and delightful 'Recollections,' already several
times referred to in these pages.</p>

<p>Hegar mentions<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> that the works which occupied Brahms
during his stay at R&uuml;schlikon were the second set of
Liebeslieder, the book of songs, Lieder and Ges&auml;nge, Op. 63,
and the Vocal Quartets, Op. 64. It was at this time, also,
that he finally completed the Pianoforte Quartet in C minor.
The songs and quartets were published in the autumn by
Peters; the four Duets for Soprano and Contralto, Op. 61,
and the seven Songs for mixed Chorus, <i>a capella</i>, Op. 62,
were issued about the same time by Simrock. The Neue
Liebeslieder and the C minor Quartet for Pianoforte and
Strings did not appear till 1875.</p>

<p>From this time onward Brahms' copyrights were acquired,
as each new work was completed, by Simrock of Berlin,
with only four exceptions&mdash;N&auml;nie, Op. 82; six Vocal
Quartets, Op. 112; thirteen Canons, Op. 113, which were
bought by Peters of Leipzig; and a Prelude and Fugue for
Organ, published in 1881 as a supplement to the <i>Musikalisches
Wochenblatt</i> without opus number. In future,
therefore, we shall mention the publication, but not the
publisher, of the works. Those compositions which were
originally acquired from the composer by Breitkopf and
H&auml;rtel were resold by this firm to Simrock later on, and
appear, therefore, in the complete published catalogue of
Brahms' works as Simrock's publications.</p>

<p>The third and, as it turned out, the last season of Brahms'
work as artistic director of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
opened in due course, and at the two ante-Christmas
concerts of the season 1874-75 the following programmes
were performed: On November 8&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" style="width:90%;" summary="Programme of November 8.">

  </tr>
</table>

<p>On December 6&mdash;Beethoven's Missa Solemnis in D major.</p>

<p>Neither concert seems to have reached the usual high-water
mark of success. Of the first programme the items
most heartily appreciated were the three choral part-songs,
which, attractive in themselves and sung to perfection,
were applauded to the echo. Of doubtful wisdom was the
selection of the pianist of the occasion. Brahms, who
probably yielded to the persuasion of his committee, and
was, perhaps, guided in his choice of a concerto by the
circumstance of having played Beethoven in E flat in the
spring at Bremen, had, as we have seen, given up regular
pianoforte practice for some years, and it was inevitable that
his performance should be affected by this fact. Berlioz's
symphony, which may have owed its place in the programme
to our master's broad view of his duties as the artistic
director of an important society, was not performed with
any great aplomb or heard with particular favour, though
extra time and particular pains had been spent on its
rehearsal.</p>

<p>Beethoven's great Mass, given on December 6, was
followed with strained attention that was rewarded by a good,
though, if Brahms' supporters in the press are to be trusted,
not a perfect, performance.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'How different are these days from those of the forties,'
remarks one of the critics, 'when many a music lover would
rise and leave the room before the commencement of a
work by Beethoven.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The String Quartet in A minor was performed for the
first time in Vienna at Hellmesberger's concert of
December 3, when the andante and scherzo met with considerable
appreciation.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I have heard the string quartets several times this
winter,' writes Billroth in January, 1875. When we played
them in Carlsruhe as pianoforte duets, we took all the
tempi much too fast. Brahms desires very moderate <i>tempi</i>
throughout, as otherwise, owing to the frequent harmonic
changes, the music cannot become clear.... Beethoven,
Schumann, Wagner, Brahms, in their riper works of the
last period, all have a preference for the andante <i>tempo</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'If you should infer from all I have said that I am much
with Brahms, you would be mightily mistaken. I have only
seen him twice during the whole winter.... We correspond,
however; he is pleased when I write to him about
his things.'</p>

<p>The composer was plunged in his own special work, and
would allow neither private nor public calls to occupy his
attention, though he made an exception in favour of Bernhard
Scholz's invitation to pay an artistic visit to Breslau at the
close of the year. His doings during the next few months
afford but little material to chronicle, and we have to record
only the last four Gesellschaft programmes given under
his direction, and to lay special stress upon the extraordinary
scene of enthusiasm that followed the performance of the
German Requiem on February 28, 1875. The rendering
of the work on this occasion was one of those, rarely occurring,
which seem to hold the audience spellbound by a
magnetic sympathy with the music. It brought with it
in some mysterious way the sudden flash of revelation.
The whole audience, as it were, knew Brahms that day,
and most of what was left to be conquered, that was worth
conquering, in the musical opinion of Vienna was finally
captured. The phenomenal demonstration, joined in by
musicians of all schools, Wagnerians not excepted, that
occurred on the termination of the great work, noteworthy
from its contrast with that earlier one of 1867 which followed
the performance of the first three choruses, was the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
striking since Wagner had conducted some excerpts from
the 'Ring' in the same hall a few days previously, and had
been the recipient of a similar ovation.</p>

<p>At the close of the season Brahms laid down his conductor's
b&acirc;ton to make room for the return of Herbeck,
whose former services, especially in the formation of an
independent orchestra, had laid the society under a debt
of gratitude, and who, unable to endure the annoyances
incidental to his position as capellmeister of the opera,
resigned the post. Brahms continued his association with
the Gesellschaft as a member of the committee, taking
great interest in its councils, and exercising influence on the
concert-programmes and the appointment of professors to
the conservatoire. Each year that went by added to the
warmth of the esteem with which he was personally regarded
and to the deference shown to his judgment by the members
of the society, who were all proud of this link of association
with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Writing in May to his stepmother from idyllic summer
quarters, he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I will let you know in haste, that I am living quite
delightfully at Zigelhausen near Heidelberg. Thank you
also for the socks you have again knitted for me.... I
am not leaving Vienna, I have only given up my appointment.
You do not know the circumstances, and it would
be too prolix to tell you why. I am, however, remaining
there&mdash;and gladly. Write to me if you want money now,
or later when the holidays come off!...</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right:10%;">
'Affectionately Your <span class="smcap">Johannes</span>.'
</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I must tell you that people are very often surprised at
my knitted socks, and that I am taken such good care of!'<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms has had very interesting programmes. Unfortunately
we have lost him and Dessoff (Philharmonic) as conductors.
Both have been pushed out, and both pushed out
by Herbeck,' writes Billroth in the month of June.</p>

<p>Brahms invited Dietrich to visit him at Zigelhausen.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I saw his new works, but cannot now be quite sure
which they were,' says Dietrich in his 'Recollections.'</p>

<p>We may confidently conjecture that chief amongst them
must have been the first symphony, upon the completion
of which Brahms was at this time concentrating his attention,
and it is probable that he also showed the sketches of
the second symphony to his old friend.</p>

<p>It was this year that Brahms consented to become a
member for the music section of a commission for the awarding
of certain gratuities granted annually by the Austrian
Government to poor artists of talent who have produced
promising works. Three members appointed by the Minister
of Education for each of three sections&mdash;poetry, music, and
the plastic arts&mdash;examine the applications and work sent,
and judge between them. The fund was established in
1863, and the original adjudicators in the music section were
Hanslick, Herbeck, and Essen. Brahms now replaced Essen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and a little later Goldmark succeeded Herbeck. The
compositions were sent in the first place to Hanslick, who
generally made a selection from them for Brahms' inspection,
keeping back such as did not fulfil the required
conditions or were hopelessly bad. In the <i>Neue Freie Presse</i>
of June 29, 1897, Hanslick made public a few of the communications
he had received from Brahms on these occasions,
the first of which, dated September, 1875, was as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Parcels such as your last are generally so thorny
that some kind preliminary guidance like yours is most
welcome and necessary as a help in finding one's way
through. This time, however, things are not so bad, and
seem to me fairly simple. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k and Reinhold thoroughly
deserve your proposal by their performances. In Lachner's
case (blind) well-justified sympathy counts for something.
M. certainly merits some help meanwhile. I mean he ought
to win the money more decidedly next year. N. N. alone
appears to me so undeserving of the gratuity that it might
be given uselessly in his case. Just look again at his small
and great sins. They are the most unmusical in the packet.
Alas, if he should progress further! At all events he should
desire and use the money for instruction and not for a
libretto!'</p>

<p>The Quartet in C minor for pianoforte and strings, published
in the autumn, was produced at Hellmesberger's
concert of November 18 by Brahms, Hellmesberger, Bachrich,
and Popper, and was played in Hamburg on January 3,
1876, by Levin, B&ouml;ie, Schmall, and Lee.</p>

<p>This composition must, as the reader is aware,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> be referred
to more than one period of Brahms' activity, and it can
hardly be accepted as a representative work of either.
Standing about midway, as to date of publication, between
his two great series of masterpieces for pianoforte and
strings, if it is to be classed amongst either, it must indubitably
be reckoned with that of the sixties. Internal no
less than external evidence, however, leaves little doubt
that it points back to a still earlier date. The master of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the seventies has so far succeeded in remodelling the work
of early youth as to have given to the world in the quartet
an interesting, and, on the whole, a clear, presentment of
many noble musical thoughts, but it can hardly be said
that he has effected its transformation into a homogeneous
or apparently spontaneous work of art. Kalbeck mentions
that a memorandum of Brahms assigns the date 1873-74
to the third and fourth movements. This, however, may
probably refer only to their final completion. The second
movement (the scherzo), which undoubtedly belongs to the
period of the pianoforte sonata numbered as Op. 1, is
consistently characteristic of the composer at that date.
The first and third movements suggest a transition period.
The character of the ideas of the opening allegro with its
impressive, deeply serious, first subject, and of the andante
with its sustained melodious phrases, seems to give promise
of the power which, manifested in a different mood, was
reached in the earlier-published companion works. Of the
finale it must be said that its themes are lacking in interest
and developed mechanically. It may be surmised that the
composer's pruning-knife was freely used in the course of
his successive revisions of the work, and perhaps not only
for the purpose of shortening it, but also for that of thinning
out the score. From the circumstance that this is neither
so luxuriant in detail nor so thickly instrumented as those
of the other two pianoforte quartets, the C minor has,
perhaps, the one advantage amongst the three of being the
most readily appreciable at first hearing. It must, however,
as the author conceives, be rated, as a completed work
of art, decidedly below its glorious companions.</p>

<p>The relative popularity attained by the three pianoforte
quartets in England may be fairly estimated by comparing
the numbers of their respective performances at the Popular
Concerts, London. The A major, introduced in January, 1872,
was given ten times up to October, 1900, inclusive. The
G minor, first performed in January, 1874, was given twenty-six
times up to March, 1900. The C minor, first played in
November, 1876, was not heard again until December, 1893.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Tour in Holland&mdash;Third String Quartet&mdash;C minor Symphony&mdash;First
performances&mdash;Varying impressions created by the work in Vienna
and Leipzig&mdash;Brahms and Widmann at Mannheim&mdash;Second Symphony&mdash;Vienna
and Leipzig differ as to its merits.</p>


<p>A journey to Holland early in 1876 brought unmixed
gratification to the master. He conducted the Haydn
Variations, and played the D minor Concerto at Utrecht on
January 22 before an audience which received him with
warm greeting, and gave every possible evidence of appreciation
of his works. Immense applause followed each movement
of the concerto, and at its close, when enthusiasm was
at its height, two youthful ladies advanced to the platform,
each bearing a cushion on which a wreath was placed, one
decorated with ribbons of the Austrian colours (black and
yellow), the other with those of Holland (red, white, and
blue), which they smilingly presented to the composer.
Brahms, not always inclined to receive tributes of the kind
with urbanity, entered thoroughly into the happy spirit of
this occasion, and showed plainly by his manner of accepting
the compliment his pleasure at the charming way in which
it had been offered. He was the guest during his several
days' stay at Utrecht of Professor and Frau Engelmann,
in whose house he at once became at home, dividing his
time between walking, talking, playing with the children,
making music with his hostess, seeing friends, and was in
genial mood throughout the visit. It may be remarked
<i>en passant</i> that Brahms in a companionable frame of mind
was not accustomed to let his friends off easily. His constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
was so robust, his spirit so active, his interests
so numerous, that he liked, and expected others to like, to
sit up talking with vivacity until the small hours of the
morning, and would rise after about five hours' rest as
unwearied and energetic as though he had had what would
be for most people a normal amount of repose. It was a
matter of course wherever he stayed that the means for
making a cup of coffee should be left every night at his
disposal for the next morning, and he generally returned
from an early walk at about the hour when the household
was beginning to stir.</p>

<p>After leaving Holland the master took part as conductor
and pianist in concerts at M&uuml;nster, where he directed the
Triumphlied, Mannheim and Wiesbaden, playing the
D minor Concerto on each occasion. He was, of course,
the guest at M&uuml;nster of Grimm and his wife. At Mannheim
he stayed with his friend the well-known capellmeister Ernst
Frank, who in the course of his career was associated as
conductor with the musical life of W&uuml;rzburg, Vienna,
Mannheim, and Hanover. The Wiesbaden concert is still
vividly remembered by the present Landgraf of Hesse,
who, then a young lad, heard Brahms for the first time on
the occasion, and received an impression which laid the
foundation of his enduring enthusiasm for the master's art.</p>

<p>Staying in the summer at Sassnitz in the Isle of R&uuml;gen,
Brahms there completed his third String Quartet in B flat
major, and announced the work in September to Professor
Engelmann, to whom it is dedicated. It was played in
Berlin before a private audience towards the end of October
by the Joachim Quartet party, and by the same artists for
the first time in public at their concert of October 30 in
the hall of the Singakademie, on both occasions from the
manuscript. The first concert performance after publication
was that of the Hellmesberger party on November 30 in
Vienna.</p>

<p>The general remarks offered in the preceding chapter on
Brahms' chamber music for strings are to be applied to the
Quartet in B flat major. Of its particular characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
we may note the joyousness of the first movement, and
the weird fantastic pathos of the third, in which a special
relation is maintained between the viola and first violin.
In the theme&mdash;of distinguished simplicity&mdash;and variations,
with which the work closes, we have a concise but beautiful
example of the composer's facility in this form.</p>

<p>The String Quartet in B flat was the first of the three
composed by Brahms to be heard at the Popular Concerts,
London. It was played on Monday, February 19, and
Saturday, March 3, 1877, by Joachim, Ries, Straus, and
Piatti. The A minor was performed on Monday, October 31,
1881, by Straus, Ries, Zerbini, and Piatti, and the C minor
on Monday, December 7, 1855, by Madame Norman-N&eacute;ruda,
Ries, Straus, and Franz N&eacute;ruda. These (Op. 51, Nos. 1
and 2) were not immediately repeated.</p>

<p>The great event of the year 1876 in the career of Brahms
was the appearance of the long looked for symphony.
As in the case of the Schicksalslied and the completed
Triumphlied, the composer chose to produce his work for
the first time at Carlsruhe, preferring, maybe, to test it for
his own satisfaction in the comparative privacy of a small
audience before submitting it to the searching ordeal of
performance in either of the great musical centres of the
Continent. The musical life of Carlsruhe had suffered sadly
by the departure of Levi in 1872, and it was not until the
appointment of Dessoff to the post of court capellmeister,
on his resignation of his duties in Vienna in 1875, that the
city began to regain some of its former artistic prestige.
The performance on November 4, 1876, from the manuscript,
of Brahms' first Symphony by the grand ducal orchestra
under Dessoff, in the composer's presence, was a musical
event that revived the recollections of a brilliant past, and
added a new and abiding distinction to the artistic traditions
of the small capital.</p>

<p>The work was heard a few days later in Mannheim, and
on the 15th of the month in Munich; on both occasions
under the composer's direction. Four other performances
from the manuscript quickly followed&mdash;in Vienna (Gesellschaft),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
December 17, in Leipzig, January 18, and Breslau,
January 23, 1877, in each case under the composer, and in
Cambridge, March 8, 1877, under Joachim's direction.</p>

<p>The Symphony in C minor, whose appearance marks the
period of Brahms' achievement in the highest domain of
absolute music, and the last that remained to him for
conquest, is in the first place remarkable from the fact that
it cannot properly be ranged beside the works in the same
form produced by either of the two masters who were,
chronologically speaking, his immediate predecessors. By
its accomplishment, no less than by its aim, it must be
regarded as the immediate successor to the symphonies
of Beethoven in the same sense as these were the direct
descendants of the symphonies of Mozart and Haydn,
and it establishes Brahms' right to be accepted in its own
domain as the heir, <i>par excellence</i>, of one and all of these
masters. This alone were much. Still more important,
however, is the fact that our composer has known how to
graft upon the symphony form inherited from Beethoven,
Mozart, and Haydn, the giant stock of Bach's learning and
resource, studied and absorbed by him until they had
become a part of his own artistic individuality, in such a
manner as to revivify it root and branch, and make it a
supple instrument in his hand, not for the mechanical
imitation of what had been done before him, but for the
'highest ideal musical expression of his own time.'<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Few
who listen with quickened ears to an adequate performance
of the C minor Symphony can be in doubt that whilst in
outward form and manner of construction it may be
regarded as at once the epitome and the latest result of the
past history of classical instrumental art, it is in spirit
representative of its own time and even anticipatory of the
future; that it not only reflects the soul of the musician,
poet, and philosopher, but is suggestive of the higher vision
of the prophet. It is this fact, for those who accept it as a
fact, that constitutes the highest significance of Brahms'
first symphony, and lends a real meaning to B&uuml;low's well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
apophthegm of 'the three B's': Bach, Beethoven,
and Brahms.</p>

<p>The shrill, clashing dissonances of the first introduction
at once place the listener in the atmosphere of stern grandeur,
passion, mystery, that surround, not this or that human life,
but existence itself, in its apprehension by human intelligence;
and the allegro to which it leads seems to the present
writer to present as near an analogy as art can show to the
processes of nature, built up as it is&mdash;first and second subjects
and their treatment&mdash;from a few notes; from what one of
the Vienna critics called 'mere twigs of thematic material';
from germs which are produced and reproduced, are transformed
and reformed, and developed into a great organic
whole instinct with noble, living melody. The solemnly
fervent andante sostenuto, the graceful, innocent allegretto
with its sufficiently contrasted trio, afford the mind the
refreshment of change of tone after the stormy splendour of
the first movement; but the note of tragedy is resumed with
the first sounds of the wonderful adagio that precedes, and
essentially contains, the allegro of the fourth movement.
Here, for some twenty-eight bars, the tension of feeling
increases till destiny itself seems to be held in suspense;
then, with the resolution of a chromatic chord, the horn
sounds the unexpected major third of the key in a six-four
of the tonic triad, and, continuing its strange, passionate
cry, gradually disperses the mists of doubt and apprehension
that have held the hearer as in a thrall, and carries him
forward to the sublimity of joy that dwells in the final allegro.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The last movement of your C minor Symphony,' wrote
Billroth to Brahms in 1890, fourteen years after its first
performance, 'has again lately excited me fearfully. Of
what avail is the perfect, clear beauty of the principal
subject in its thematically complete form? The horn
returns at length with its romantic, impassioned cry as in
the introduction, and all palpitates with longing, rapture
and supersensuous exaltation and bliss.'</p>

<p>These words were not written by a fantastic dreamer, but
by one of the most renowned scientific and practical surgeons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and busiest men of his time, and in using them he did not
employ a mere rhetorical phrase. The quality of imagination
which speaks through Brahms' first symphony is akin
to that of the early Sonata in F minor, though it is expressed
in the later work with the help of more than twenty years
additional study and experience. It is that of a seer of
visions, and seems to culminate, in the passage to which
Billroth alluded, in an ecstasy of wonder and joy. Brahms
undoubtedly rose to the full height of his great powers in
this first symphony, which remains unsurpassed in workmanship
and sustained loftiness of idea, as well as in regard to
the range of emotion to which it appeals.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the supposed merits and
demerits of the work became the subject of heated argument
between the partisans and antagonists of the composer's art,
the particulars of which would scarcely prove interesting to
readers of the present day. In giving some account of the
first impressions made by the symphony, we shall quote
from those notices only which, whilst they are in themselves
not without value, appear to have been written in a candid
spirit, and do not offensively betray the influence of party
bias. The reputation attaching to Hanslick's name, and the
moderation of his style, seem to make it necessary to include
something from his report, though he was avowedly a
stanch admirer of Brahms' music, and had little liking for
that of the New-German school. To balance this, we shall
give a few sentences from the <i>Wiener Zeitung</i>, a journal to
which, as the reader may remember, no suspicion can attach
of handling our master's works with an excess of cordiality.
It is necessary to explain, for the benefit of such readers as
are not familiar with Brahms' large works, that the references
to Beethoven's ninth symphony occurring in some of
the press notices are occasioned by what has sometimes been
described as Brahms' intentional allusion, in the principal
theme of his finale, to Beethoven's setting of Schiller's 'Ode
to Joy' in the last movement of the great 'ninth.' The
so-called allusion consists, not so much in a similarity of
melody in Brahms' theme to that of Beethoven, as in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
being written in the same hymn-form and harmonized as
plainly as possible. There is no doubt whatever that everyone
who listens to Brahms' first symphony thinks immediately,
on the entrance of the final allegro, of Beethoven's
ninth. The association passes with the conclusion of the
subject; Brahms' movement develops on its own lines,
which do not resemble those of Beethoven.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'In this work,' says Hanslick (<i>Neue Freie Presse</i>),
'Brahms' close affinity with Beethoven must become clear
to every musician who has not already perceived it. The
new symphony displays an energy of will, a logic of musical
thought, a greatness of structural power and a mastery of
technique such as are possessed by no other living composer.
It would be a sorry mistake to attempt to criticize a work
so serious and difficult of comprehension immediately after
hearing it for the first time. Various listeners may have
found the music more or less clear, more or less sympathetic;
the one thing that we may speak of as a simple fact, accepted
alike by friend and foe, is that no composer has yet
approached so nearly to the great works of Beethoven as
Brahms in the finale of the C minor Symphony.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... Brahms was an important personality, one to be
treated most seriously before he wrote the symphony,' we
read in the <i>Wiener Zeitung</i>; 'to our thinking his position
remains just as it was. The strong moral earnestness, the
depth and purity of his conception of the world and of life,
and the intellectuality, which have always obtained for
the esteem of the noble-minded and withheld from him the
favour of the masses, are to be found again in this work.
None the less, however, are the shadows there which but too
easily accompany such lights; the want of inspiriting fancy,
the absence of sensuous charm, and a sullen asceticism
almost amounting to insipidity. His musical language has
lost nothing of its mysterious reticence, of its close conciseness,
of the elevation that on the whole distinguishes it, nor
has it gained in facility, clearness, or comprehensibility....
So there is nothing that can be admired without reserve,
until with sure step, with strong, proud gait that reminds one
of the majesty of Beethoven, the finale strides out. After
a bar or two of deeply sorrowful complaint, it braces itself to
a turbulent pizzicato of the strings, as a man who would get
rid of pain by nerving himself to action.... With the
entry of the chorale, the hearer experiences a sensation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>brightness as at the rising of the sun after a night of sorrow.
The last mists disappear as before the breaking light, and
the movement closes in strong, healthy gladness....
Here the arts of music and poetry mingle indissolubly, and
the musical, cannot be separated from the poetic, impression.
Here is a truly great artistic achievement, the value of which
is but slightly prejudiced by the consideration that the
"joy" theme has an unmistakable resemblance as of son to
father to that of the "ninth" symphony. This movement is
worthy of the man who composed the German Requiem.'</p>

<p>D&ouml;rffel, of the <i>Leipziger Nachrichten</i>, wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The interest of all present was centred on the new
symphony, which, on the whole, justified the great expectations
with which it had been awaited. Its effect on the
audience was the most intense that has been produced by
any new symphony within our remembrance. Schumann
in his time did not attain such.... The composition is to
be viewed and measured from the standpoint of Beethoven's
ninth, and of Schumann's second, symphony. The aim of the
three works is the same. To reach it, Brahms, well-equipped
and daring spirit as he is, goes his own way. He is great in
attack as his two predecessors, and has the same wide vision
over the domain of spiritual-human existence.... As
regards uninterrupted energy of creative power, we would
give the palm to the first movement. The second, with its
fervour and longing, accords with it. To the third we
should gladly have listened longer. It supplied a counterpoise
of sentiment to what had gone before which had not
been maintained long enough when the movement closed.
Of the finale we would almost venture to surmise that it
gave the composer the most trouble. Here he relinquishes
his independence, and flies to Beethoven in order to get new
force for his climax. We do not regard the resort to
Beethoven as accidental, but believe the composer to have
been well aware of it. He came, however, to one over whom
he could not prevail.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'A long pause followed the symphony; one, however, that
was not long enough in some measure to quiet the exaltation
of mind produced by the work. The songs and variations
which followed, and which we should have welcomed at
another time, were almost tiresome to us. Let the symphony
be repeated soon, and, if possible, without other music.'<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Louis Ehlert says of the symphony:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms has a wide-reaching and speculative brain, and
is a mixture of the musician of the good old times who heard
many voices sounding together within him, whose very
cradle cover was embroidered with a contrapuntal pentagram,
and of the man of the present day with his variously
cultured intellect.... What distinguishes his music from
that of all his contemporaries is the mysterious apparition
within it of another world&mdash;its gentle, pathetic tapping at
the heart.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The first movement of the symphony is, perhaps, the
most artistically important of the work.... An inexorable
causality proceeds from bar to bar, stayed by no illusion,
and softened only by the distant light of a few solitary stars.
In the introduction and finale the enigmatical sphinx seems
to call to us, "That which ascends from me, mounting upwards
to battle and to life, sinks back again within me. Of
all life I, the eternal riddle, am the beginning and the end."'</p>

<p>It will be evident from what has been said that whatever
the impression to be derived from familiar acquaintance
with the symphony, immediate enthusiasm could hardly
have been anticipated from any large general public&mdash;least
of all by Brahms himself; but the presence at most of these
first performances of devotees specially qualified for apprehending
something of the significance of the work generally
secured for it more than a mere <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>. The listeners
of Munich were the least appreciative. Those of Carlsruhe,
Mannheim and Breslau were friendly. At Vienna certain
favoured friends were privileged to listen to a private performance
of the symphony by Brahms and Ignaz Br&uuml;ll, in
the composer's arrangement as a pianoforte duet, at the
pianoforte house of his friend Herr Hoffabrikant Friedrich
Ehrbar, and went to the concert, therefore, with minds
partially prepared for what they were to hear. At Leipzig
a note of enthusiasm was perceptible at the crowded public
rehearsal which preceded the Gewandhaus concert, owing
partly to the fact that Brahms' Leipzig adherents had been
strongly reinforced by the advent of friends from outside,
some of whom added warmth and prestige to the occasion
by their mere presence. The feeling for our master's art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
which, as we have seen, had been slowly growing amongst
a number of Leipzig residents who belonged to no musical
'set,' will have been expressed with added zest and enjoyment
when it was found that Frau Schumann and Joachim
and Stockhausen had come to hear the symphony, whilst
to the support of the von Herzogenbergs, von Holsteins,
Theodor Kirchner, and other resident or lately resident
friends, was added that of the Grimms from M&uuml;nster,
Dr. Hermann Deiters from Bonn, Professor and Frau Engelmann
from Utrecht, Simrock from Berlin, and many other
distinguished guests. Enthusiasm is contagious, and already
at the rehearsal a success was ensured for the work, though
perhaps it was not very warmly helped by the official
patrons of the Gewandhaus.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'A regular Brahms party meeting had been organized,'
says Bernsdorf in the <i>Signale</i>, now as ever inveterate in
his own party bias, in which a fairly strong contingent
from outside was associated with the resident admirers and
champions of the composer. It is therefore a matter of
course that the consumption of enthusiasm was enormous,
and that the success of the symphony was one exceptional
in the annals of the Gewandhaus.'</p>

<p>A large party of friends assembled at supper at the H&ocirc;tel
Hauffe after the concert. Brahms' health was proposed
in genial fashion by Stockhausen. 'Hab' ich tausendmal
geschworen,'<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> he suddenly sang out, starting to his feet
and raising his glass. Needless to say that the toast,
which was the more effective from the sense of victory
filling the minds of those who had assisted at the evening's
triumph, was honoured with the utmost enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The performance of the symphony by the Cambridge
University Musical Society was given under special circumstances.
Early in the year the university offered the
master an honorary degree, acceptance of which would
have involved him in a visit to England, since, by one of
the university statutes, its degrees may not be conferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
<i>in absentia</i>. Brahms was not asked to write a new work
for the occasion, a request he would properly have resented,
but was merely invited to visit Cambridge for the purpose
of receiving the degree, and was so far gratified by the compliment
as to hesitate about his answer. Perhaps his mere
reluctance to decline the invitation in spite of his dread of
English customs and his ignorance of the language, may be
accepted as stronger testimony of appreciation than might
have been implied in the effusive acceptance of many
another man. It may be doubted whether he would in
any case have prevailed upon himself to undertake the
journey; an indiscreet advertisement, however, inserted in
<i>The Times</i> by the Crystal Palace directors, who had heard
a rumour of his possible visit, that if he should come he
would be asked to conduct one of their Saturday concerts,
immediately decided him to decline the University's
proffered honour. He acknowledged the invitation by
entrusting the MS. score and parts of the symphony to
the care of Joachim, who was about starting on his yearly
visit to England, for performance at Cambridge.</p>

<p>The programme of March 8 was as follows:</p>

<p>The Symphony and the Elegiac Overture, the latter composed

conductor, C. Villiers Stanford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>The concert attracted a great audience, which included
prominent musicians from various parts of the United
Kingdom. The impression created by the symphony was
profound, and, following that of the German Requiem and
of the great chamber music compositions and songs which
had now for some years been finding their way to the hearts
of music lovers in this country, formed, as Stanford says,
'an imperishable keystone to Brahms' fame amongst
Britons.'<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The new work was performed in London a few
weeks later at the Philharmonic concert of April 16, under
W. G. Cusins.</p>

<p>Probably Brahms' Vienna friends and admirers little
dreamed how near they had been at this time to losing their
favourite. The position of municipal music-director at
D&uuml;sseldorf was pressed on his acceptance in the autumn of
1876, and he was sufficiently tempted by it to be characteristically
unable to decide on a negative answer. He was,
indeed, so long in coming to a final resolution, that the
D&uuml;sseldorf authorities had every reason to feel persuaded
they had secured him for the opening of the year 1877. At
the last moment he wrote: 'I cannot make up my mind
to it.' This seems to have been the last occasion on which
he entertained the idea of binding himself to the performance
of fixed duties, though it has been surmised that he might
have consented at a somewhat later period to associate himself
with a high class for composition at the conservatoire
of the Vienna 'Gesellschaft,' if he had been approached by
the principal, Josef Hellmesberger, on the subject of
forming one.</p>

<p>Certain incidents belonging to the autumn of 1877, related
by Widmann in his Brahms' 'Recollections,' show that at
this time, when the master had successfully proved his
powers in every form of composition for the concert-room,
the old desire to try his hand at writing for the stage revived
within him. Brahms and Widmann met at Mannheim, and
were present at the production, on September 30, of G&ouml;tz's
unfinished opera, 'Francesca di Rimini,' under Frank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
In the course of a long <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, held on their return to
their hotel after the performance, Brahms clearly explained
his views on the subject of opera texts, 'letting it be seen,'
says Widmann, 'that any resolution he might have formed
against composing an opera might give way were he to
find himself in possession of a libretto really to his liking.'</p>

<p>The convictions professed on this occasion by the composer
may be traced to an attitude of mind similar to that
to which we referred on recording his conversation with
Bulthaupt. Strange as it may appear, they have a fundamental
kinship with those which led Wagner to embark on
his career as a musico-dramatic reformer, though the
methods proposed by Brahms were not only much more
drastic than those pursued by Wagner, but ran, as Widmann
has observed, directly in the opposite direction from
that taken by the development of modern art as represented
by this master.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The composition of music to the entire drama seemed to
Brahms unnecessary and even mischievous. Only the
culminating points and those parts of the action should be
set for which music would be an inherently suitable medium
of expression. The librettist would thus gain space and
freedom for the dramatic development of his subject, whilst
the composer would be at liberty to devote himself solely to
the purposes of his art which would be best served if he
were able to concentrate his energies on a definite situation
such as a jubilant <i>ensemble</i>.'</p>

<p>From this it would appear that the incongruity essential
to the very existence of what is generally understood as
Opera, as distinct from the early German Singspiel,
was so strongly felt by Brahms as to seem to him incompatible
with dramatic truth, and to be absolutely prohibitive
in his own case of the dramatic exercise of his art.
The matter is, however, susceptible of another explanation.</p>

<p>It is clear that Brahms, when contemplating the composition
of an opera, was bound by the necessities of his
position to seek the attainment of dramatic truth in a direction
other than that in which Wagner had led the way with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
such triumphant result. Every circumstance in the careers
of the two men, and not least the representative position
achieved by each in his own sphere, precluded the possibility
that Brahms should run the risk of appearing to seek
to emulate Wagner on his own ground, though it would be
difficult to believe that he at no time cast longing thoughts
towards the logical, consistent, rich means of artistic effect
offered by the Melos.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> No one can doubt that if he had
been in a position, and had chosen, to use it, he would have
employed it in his own way and for his own original purposes
and effects. The skill with which he might have
handled it in opera is to some small extent indicated in the
Rhapsody (Goethe's 'Harzreise'), where the method of the
two first sections is very much that of the Melos, whilst the
prayer, affording an opportunity 'inherently suitable for
musical expression,' reverts to the rhythmical melody of
musical tradition. That Brahms had a respect almost
amounting to veneration for Wagner's powers is matter of
common knowledge. Though he was never present at a
Bayreuth performance, he had studied Wagner's scores
exhaustively, and, in the sense of his intimate acquaintance
with them, was accustomed to call himself the 'best of all
Wagnerians.' An anecdote related by Richard Heuberger,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
to whom the master gave informal instruction in composition
for a time from early in 1878, is highly illustrative in
this connection. Heuberger says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... Continuing his corrections, Brahms did not confine
himself to remarks on the composition itself, but considered
the handwriting also worthy of his notice. He pointed out
that I had not placed crotchet under crotchet, and that
this impaired the legibility of the manuscript; he advised
me to be particular to slur the groups of notes with exactness....
"Look here," he said, fetching from the next
room Wagner's autograph score of "Tannh&auml;user," which
he opened at the long B major movement of the second act;
"Wagner has taken pains to place each of the five sharps
exactly in its place on <i>every</i> line of <i>every</i> page, and in spite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>of all this precision the writing is easy and flowing. If <i>such</i>
a man can write so neatly, you must do so too." He turned
over the entire movement and pointed reproachfully to
almost every sharp. I felt continually smaller, especially
as Brahms talked himself into a kind of didactic wrathfulness.
I was struck completely dumb, however, when, on
my remarking that Wagner must be held chiefly responsible
for the confusion prevailing in the heads of us young people,
Brahms cried as though he had been stung, "<i>Nonsense</i>;
the <i>misunderstood</i> Wagner has done it. Those understand
<i>nothing</i> of the real Wagner who are led astray by him.
Wagner's is one of the clearest heads that ever existed in
the world!"'</p>

<p>That Brahms was aware that the resolution to compose
an opera would place him in a net of difficulties that might
practically be summed up in the one word 'Wagner' is
no mere conjecture. Fr&auml;ulein Anna Ettlinger, an intimate
friend of Levi and Allgeyer, who knew Brahms well both at
Carlsruhe and Munich, relates in an article on Levi, that
Brahms answered a question put to him in Munich in the
course of the seventies, as to why he had written no opera
by saying, 'Beside Wagner it is impossible.' It may fairly
be concluded that Brahms, in the late seventies, merely
'coquetted,' as Widmann expresses it, with the idea of
composing for the stage, though no doubt with considerable
regret.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>It cannot be said that the subjects he proposed to Widmann
appear happy, but his suggestions must not be taken
too seriously.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'He recommended to me Gozzi's magical farces and fabled
comedies, especially "King Stag" and "The Ravens."
He was also interested in "The Open Secret," and preferred
Gozzi's lighter arrangement of the piece to Calderon's more
formal original.... After reading "King Stag" carefully
through several times, I was not only seized with a certain
hopelessness as to whether I could ever succeed in making
a rational, poetical opera text out of this mad farce, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>disturbed by the anxiety as to whether, even if it were
successfully adapted, it could really interest a modern
theatre-going public.... I found myself continually
thinking that such an opera, even though Brahms had composed
for it the most beautiful, glorious music, as would
undoubtedly have been the case, could not be regarded as
essentially anything else than a sort of second "Zauberfl&ouml;te,"
and thus as a retrogression in the development of
operatic art.'<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Nothing, in short, resulted from the talk between Brahms
and Widmann, and the suitable libretto was, as we know,
never found. This is, perhaps, little to be regretted. Not,
indeed, because the composer lacked the dramatic instinct
necessary for the successful composition of opera. No one
who has heard him quote a few lines from a classical play
can doubt that he possessed this qualification in an eminent
degree, and his sensitiveness to dramatic effect was matter
for frequent comment by those who accompanied him to
the theatre. It is, however, difficult to imagine that Brahms
could have been content to compose music to a purely
comic text, or, indeed, to one that did not contain elements
of deep pathos; whilst a quasi-comic opera, in which allegory
lay hidden, must almost certainly have been found, as
Widmann perceived, unsuitable to modern taste. On the
other hand, Brahms' constitutional shyness and reticence,
fostered through long years of varied experience until they
became invincible, must, we believe, have proved obstacles
to the successful completion of a serious opera in any
practicable meaning of the word, even if they had allowed
him to attempt one. They are more or less traceable in
the libretto difficulty; in his suggestion of 'King Stag,'
which he recommended especially on account of its fun,
'accompanied throughout by the most pathetic earnestness';
in other words, because the earnestness is covered by
the fun. It is difficult to imagine the man who habitually
veiled the tenderness of his nature behind a playful saying
or an abrupt manner, who did not allow himself to inquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
about the possibilities of passionate feeling that might lie
dormant within him, coming out of his reserve to use the
strong play of emotion as the immediate and capital medium
for his effects. The energy of feeling, the deeply pathetic
beauty which vitalize the master's purely instrumental
music, are surrounded and protected by an intellectual
atmosphere which, on a first hearing of his larger works,
sometimes seems to amount to austerity, and to repel
rather than attract. His love-songs&mdash;those of them which
are not folk-songs&mdash;are for the most part dreamings of an
ideal, and not the ideal of a man who could lay his heart
bare on the theatre boards. Not wholly fanciful is the
association in which Brahms, in a letter to Widmann,
jokingly placed his two life renunciations, of the composition
of an opera and of marriage. The extracts from
favourite authors entered by Johannes during the early
fifties in the little manuscript books described by Kalbeck,
the passages found in 'The young Kreisler's treasure-chest,
March, 1854,' remain significant not only of the young
musician of twenty, but also of the master of forty, fifty,
sixty years, and the quotation from Friedrich v. Sallet
might probably stand as the true history of Brahms' inner
life.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'One generally finds the highest degree of what is called
<i>openness</i> in the most frivolous and thoughtless persons;
of that which is called <i>reserve</i>, in the deepest, richest and
truest minds. And, indeed, I am glad to be communicative,
and like a full, free flow of conversation during the
clinking of cups; whatever noble thought may have occurred
to me should not have been gained for myself, but, if possible,
for the world. Nevertheless, there is in the mind a holy of
holies. I would not bring that forth which shines brightly
there, hidden away in the inmost recess, to glimmer vainly
and childishly in the universal light of day. Let it remain
there in sacred night. I dare not even tell it in barren
words to my friend, however noble, not even to my beloved
(if I had one). To what purpose? I might use one single
misleading expression, the other might misunderstand one
single expression, and my divine image, reflected from a
concave mirror, become a distortion, common or trivial, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>even deformed and ridiculous.... To analyze and describe
the sacred within us is a shameless desecration. If the
other has a spiritual eye that is worthy to perceive, he may
quietly await one of those blissful moments when the
curtain of mists breaks and a swift, comprehensive glance
into the sanctuary of the temple is allowed to the worthy
one, and in such moments is celebrated the high festival of
friendship as of love. For myself, I dare reveal nothing of
it in words save in poetry. There I may do so, for it happens
in some divine way that is incomprehensible to me....'<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>We have henceforth, therefore, only to observe the unwearied
energy with which Brahms, during the succeeding
years, added one work after another to the list of his compositions
in each and every branch of serious music for the
chamber and the concert-room: songs, vocal duets, choral
works and instrumental solos accompanied and unaccompanied,
concerted music for solo instruments, symphonies.
The publications of the year 1877 were the Symphony and
the four sets of Songs, Op. 69, 70, 71, 72, twenty-four songs
in all, some of the texts of which are by Carl Candidus, Carl
Lemke, Gottfried Keller, etc., and others imitations of
folk-songs of various nationalities. Dr. Deiters says of
them in his 'Johannes Brahms':</p>

<p class="blockquot">'As it seems to us, the composer identifies himself here
more and more closely with classical form and achieves ever
purer refinement of his material. Turn where one will (we
mention for instance "Des Liebsten Schwur" from Op. 69)
there can be no hesitation in counting these songs with the
best to be found of their kind. Again we are constantly
reminded of Franz Schubert, whose wealth of melody is
revived, whilst in conciseness of construction, in conscious
mastery of form, he is here greatly surpassed.'</p>

<p>Heuberger gives a pleasant glimpse of Brahms co-operating
in a festival performance arranged for December, 1877, by
the Academic Choral Society of Vienna in honour of its
distinguished honorary member, Billroth. Invited by Heuberger,
Dr. Eyrich's successor as conductor of the society,
to take part in the proceedings, the master at once promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
to conduct two of his choruses, 'Ich schnell mein Horn'
and 'Lied vom Herrn von Falkenstein,' as arranged for the
occasion for men's voices by Heuberger, and, on his appearance
at the last rehearsal to go through the well-prepared
compositions, was greeted with a hurricane of welcome by
the over two hundred students who formed the choir. At
the festival performance next day</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms joined in the students' songs as lustily as his
rough, broken voice would permit. He had, as he told me,
a very good soprano voice as a boy, but had spoilt it by
singing too much during its mutation period.'</p>

<p>Of another occasion, a party at Billroth's house, when
choruses by Brahms and Goldmark were to be performed,
Heuberger relates:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'By Brahms' suggestion I directed the preliminary practices
which took place at the houses of some of his friends,
the Osers and others. The day before the party Brahms
and Goldmark came to the last rehearsal. The so-reputed
cross-grained Brahms now conducted his "Marienlieder"
and other works without much alteration of the nuances
that I had practised. Goldmark, on the contrary, who
was as much liked in private life as he was dreaded at
rehearsal, studied indefatigably on and on.'<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The publication of Brahms' first Symphony in C minor
was almost immediately followed by the appearance of a
second one in D major, completed during the summer months
of 1877 at the beloved Lichtenthal. It was, like the earlier
work, played by Brahms and Br&uuml;ll before an invited circle
at Ehrbar's as a pianoforte duet (composer's arrangement)
a few days before the date, December 11, first announced
for its performance at a Vienna Philharmonic concert.
Cause arose at the last moment for the postponement of
this event, and the work was given for the first time in public
at the succeeding Philharmonic concert of December 30,
under Hans Richter's direction. The second performance,
conducted by Brahms, took place at the Leipzig Gewandhaus
on January 10, 1878.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The early fortunes of this second symphony were
singularly various, and contrasted strangely with those of
its predecessor. In Vienna, where the first had been received
with reserve, the second achieved an instant, almost
popular, success. It was warmly received by the audience,
and was discussed by nearly all sections of the press in terms
of cordial approval. It was of a 'more attractive character,'
more 'understandable' than its predecessor. It was to
be preferred, too, inasmuch as the composer had not this
time 'entered the lists with Beethoven.' The third movement
was especially praised for its 'original melody and
rhythms.' The work might be appropriately termed the
'Vienna Symphony,' reflecting as it did 'the fresh, healthy
life only to be found in beautiful Vienna.' In Leipzig, on
the other hand, the work was little better than a failure.
The impression of the preceding year was felt in the general
applause, emphasized by a thrice-repeated flourish of
trumpets and drums, which greeted the composer's entrance,
and the audience maintained an attitude of polite cordiality
throughout the performance of the symphony, courteously
applauding between the movements and recalling the
master at the end; but the enthusiasm of personal friends
was not this time able to kindle any corresponding warmth
in the bulk of the audience, or even to cover the general
consciousness of the fact. The most favourable of the
press notices damned the work with faint praise, and
D&ouml;rffel, whom we quote here and elsewhere because he
alone of the professional Leipzig critics of the seventies
seems to have been imbued with a sense of Brahms' artistic
greatness, showed himself quite angry from disappointment.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The Viennese,' he wrote, 'are much more easily satisfied
than we. We make quite different demands on Brahms,
and require from him music which is something more than
"pretty" and "very pretty" when he comes before us as
a symphonist. Not that we do not wish to hear him in
his complaisant moods, not that we disdain to accept from
him pictures of real life, but we desire always to contemplate
his genius, whether he displays it in a manner of his
own, or depends on that of Beethoven. We have not discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>genius in the new symphony and should hardly
have guessed it to be the work of Brahms had it been performed
anonymously. We should have recognised the
great mastery of form, the extremely skilful handling of the
material, the conspicuous power of construction in short,
which it displays, but should not have described it as pre-eminently
distinguished by inventive power. We should
have pronounced the work to be one worthy of respect,
but not counting for much in the domain of symphony.
Perhaps we may be mistaken; if so, the error should be
pardonable, arising as it does from the great expectations
which our reverence for the composer induced us to form.'</p>

<p>Possibly D&ouml;rffel's expectations had been founded too
definitely upon his admiration of the first symphony, which
may have caused him to take for granted that he would find
in the second a reiteration of the exalted moods of its predecessor.
The two works should not, however, be weighed
in the balance one against the other, but should be considered
side by side for the reason that they are not only different,
but, as it were, supplementary. The first partakes of the
nature of an epic in so far as it is conceived on a grand
scale and is dominated throughout three of its four movements
by a passionate intensity of feeling which is occupied
only with the sublimities, whether of pain or of joy, and
which, even after the pain has been conquered, seems to
touch the joy theme itself with the pathos of a past tragedy.
The second symphony is an idyll that is chiefly animated
by the spirit of pure happiness and gently tender grace.
A second symphony quickly following the first, which had
shown any attempt to emulate that great work on its own
ground, must of necessity have been doomed to result in
artistic failure. The second symphony which the master
actually wrote was one which, whilst it probably satisfied
a need of his mind for the refreshment of change, was the
appropriate sequel to its predecessor both in regard to its
calm serenity of mood and to the clear melody of the
thematic material in which the mood is so perfectly expressed.
Those who are inexorable in their demands for
'originality' may, however, be referred to the 'adagio non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
troppo,' which, with its melodious phrases and its beautiful
tone effects, its varied rhythms and its mysterious intention,
offers opportunity for the energetic attention even of the
accustomed listener, and is the one movement of the work
which can hardly be at once followed with entire pleasure
by the less initiated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the first symphony was quickly making its
way through Europe. It was given with enormous success
on November 11, 1877, at a concert of the Royal Academy
of Arts, Berlin, by the orchestra of the music school under
Joachim, and was very inadequately performed on the
16th of the same month at a Hamburg Philharmonic concert
under von Bernuth. By the strongly-expressed desire
of many musicians of the city, the composer was invited
to conduct a repetition performance at the Philharmonic
concert of January 18, 1878, when the work achieved
considerable success. It was heard the same month in
Bremen and Utrecht under Brahms, in M&uuml;nster (J. O.
Grimm), Dresden (F. W&uuml;llner), and in February for the
second time in Breslau (Scholz), and made its way in the
course of a few seasons to Basle, Z&uuml;rich, Rotterdam,
Amsterdam, the Hague, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and New
York.</p>

<p>Brahms now, at the age of forty-four, was, indeed, in the
enjoyment of almost unclouded recognition and success,
which could be but little affected by the lack of enthusiasm
of this or that audience. His position had become the
more firmly established from the circumstance that very
few of his works had taken the public by storm. The
majority of them had grown almost imperceptibly into
general acceptance by sheer force of their intrinsic value,
of which but a modicum is to be found on the surface. It
is certainly the case that at the outset of his modest entry
on a public career he had gained with a single stroke, once
and for always, the enthusiastic suffrage of some of the
princes of his art; but the voice of Schumann, potent as
it was, could be and had been only of avail to procure him
a hearing&mdash;appreciation was, by the nature of things, beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
its control; and though Frau Schumann and Joachim and
Stockhausen untiringly used the influence of their position
as best beloved among the foremost favourites of the
public to make a way for his music, even they could not
immediately secure for it enthusiasm. This it had gradually
to gain by the independent means of its indwelling
virtue, the insistency of its appeal, not to the outward
seeming, but to the very heart of things.</p>

<p>A noteworthy addition was made in the course of the year
1877 to the ranks of Brahms' most stanch and influential
supporters in the person of Hans von B&uuml;low. Remark has
already been made on the change observable in the early
seventies in the attitude of this gifted, witty, whimsical,
uncompromising, true-hearted musician towards Brahms'
art. The publication of the first symphony completed his
conversion, and he soon afterwards began an active propaganda
on the master's behalf, to which, carried on as it
was with characteristic vehemence and eccentricity, and
started at the very moment when the great composer was
achieving the highest summit of fame, an entirely fictitious
importance has sometimes been ascribed in regard to its
effect upon the outward development of Brahms' career.
That von B&uuml;low during the last ten or twelve years of his
public activity partially devoted his energies to the task
of forcing the master's works upon certain more or less
indifferent audiences, whom he harangued and lectured
concerning their lack of interest, had no bearing on the
facts that Brahms' place amongst the immortals had been
assured, by practically general consent, with the first few
performances of the German Requiem, and that by the
beginning of the eighties acceptance of his art had become
world-wide. B&uuml;low's new partisanship, destined to bring
in its train distinguished friendships that were truly prized
and reciprocated by the master, was touching from its
sincerity, but is not of essential importance to Brahms'
biographer. It is, however, pleasant to be able to add to
the extracts already quoted from B&uuml;low's writings three
which, dated October and November, 1877, mark the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
beginning of a new epoch in his own career, and in that
of Brahms the commencement of an agreeable and valued
personal intimacy. The paragraphs are to be taken merely
as illustrations of B&uuml;low's changed sentiments, and not as
necessarily expressing the personal views of the present
writer.</p>

<p>With the rapidly-increasing appreciation of Brahms' art
observable during the second half of the seventies throughout
the entire musical world, the condition of his private
circumstances changed rapidly also. At the time he completed
the second symphony it was very far removed from
that of twelve years back, when he had been obliged, by
lack of ready cash, to purchase the music-paper required
for the manuscript of the Requiem in small instalments. He
never deviated from the simple manner of daily life agreeable
to him by nature and habit, but we find that in the early
spring of 1878 he added to the short list of his personal
pleasures one that became to him a source of unfailing
delight, that of a journey to Italy. On this his first visit,
made in April, in Billroth's company, he stayed in Rome,
Naples, and Sicily, and returned subjugated once and for
all by the witcheries of the South. Neither of his Italian
tours was associated with a musical purpose; they were
undertaken solely for the refreshment of body and mind
by a holiday ramble amidst beauties of nature and art, to
which his temperament made him peculiarly sensitive, and
amongst a people whose <i>naturel</i> was congenial to him.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I often think of our journey,' writes Billroth on May 7;
'that you were so charmed with everything doubles my
pleasure.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>The new symphony was included in the Rhine Festival,
held this year at D&uuml;sseldorf under Joachim and Tausch.
Amongst Joachim's duties was that of conducting the performance
of his friend's work, concerning which we read in
a contemporary journal:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The performance of Brahms' second symphony under
Joachim was a feast such as we have seldom heard. The
audience was jubilant after each movement, and would not
be satisfied till the third was repeated.'</p>

<p>And again in a final summary:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The most brilliant event of the festival was the performance
of Brahms' symphony.'</p>

<p>The composer spent the summer at P&ouml;rtschach on Lake
W&ouml;rther in Carinthia, a spot where, as he writes to Hanslick,
'so many melodies fly about one must be careful not to tread
on them.' In the same letter<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> he talks playfully to his old
friend, who, remaining a bachelor till past fifty, had lately
surprised his acquaintances by marrying a lady many years
his junior, of his intention to compose a new symphony for
the winter, 'that shall sound so gay and charming you will
think I have written it expressly for you, or rather for your
young wife.'</p>

<p>This idea, probably not seriously entertained, was put
aside, but the reflection of the composer's happy mood is
to be found in several of the pianoforte pieces written by
him at this time&mdash;notably in No. 2 of Op. 76&mdash;and in the
last movement of the great violin concerto he was composing
for Joachim.</p>

<p>An event was to take place in the last week of September
which no doubt possessed a peculiar interest for Brahms,
though it was not of an unmixed character: the celebration
of the fiftieth anniversary of the Philharmonic Society of
his native city of Hamburg, which had been founded in
1828 by a few music-lovers, with W. Grund, a composer
and teacher of the city, as its conductor. The festival was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
to last five days, and to include three great orchestral
concerts in the Saagebiel Hall and an excursion up the
Elbe to Blankenese. Four symphonies were to be performed:
Haydn in G minor, Beethoven's 'Eroica,' Schumann
in C major, Brahms in D major. Frau Schumann
was to play Mozart's Pianoforte Concerto in D minor;
Joachim to perform with Concertmeister Bargheer, Spohr's
Duo Concertante for two violins in B minor. A great
assemblage of musicians was expected, and Brahms had
been invited, but at the beginning of September no one in
Hamburg knew whether or not he intended to be present,
and the directors of the festival, finding themselves very
near a predicament, resolved to appeal to Hanslick, who
had received and accepted an invitation, to procure his
answer for them. The letter which Hanslick immediately
wrote to P&ouml;rtschach elicited from Brahms the following
reply:</p>

<p class="blockquot small right">
'<span class="smcap">P&ouml;rtschach</span>, <i>Sept., 1878</i>.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">'You have once already publicly preached to me the
doctrine of decorum; I do not wish this to occur, from no
fault of mine, a second time, and tell you, therefore, that
it will be the Hamburgers' concern if I do not appear at
their festival. I have no opportunity for showing politeness
and gratitude; on the contrary, some rudeness would
be in place if I had time and inclination to lose my temper
over the matter. I do not wish to disturb yours by
detailed communication and will therefore only say that
in spite of inquiry, not a word has been said about honorarium
or any sort of remuneration. I, poor composer, am
appraised at doubtful value and lose all right to sit at the
festival table, next to your wife, let us say. I therefore
beg this time for indulgence for my anyway impaired
reputation as a polite man. As regards the symphony,
indeed, I do not beg for indulgence, but I fear that unless
its direction be offered to Joachim as I wish, there will
be a miserable performance. Now, the dinners are good in
Hamburg, the symphony is of a favourable length&mdash;you
can dream whilst it is going on that you are in Vienna!
I am thinking of going to Vienna very soon....'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>This dubious epistle need not be taken too seriously,
true though it is that the composer rightly made it a point
throughout his career that his work should be paid for,
and, so to speak, at full market value. The tone adopted
by him on this occasion must be partly referred to the
remembrance of the old sore, which, perhaps, never quite
healed&mdash;to the mortification which had on two occasions cut
deep into the heart of the loyal Hamburger when his fellow-citizens
offered to a stranger the opportunity he would
have welcomed to settle in their midst. It is not wonderful
that the invitation to attend, and presumably to take part
in, the Jubilee Festival of the society of which, had he so
chosen, he ought since many years to have been the artistic
chief should have revived past memories in the mind of
the renowned master whose mere presence could now invest
the occasion with a peculiar significance. All's well that
ends well, however. How Brahms settled the matter with
the committee must be left to conjecture, but it is certain
that he astonished friends and acquaintance by coming to
Hamburg with a long flowing beard grown during the
summer, which changed the character of his face almost
beyond recognition. It was, as we know, his second experiment
of the kind, and the beard, which he from this time
permanently retained, certainly added to the grandeur of
his head, though some of his old friends may occasionally
have looked back with regret to the days when the firm,
purposeful mouth contributed its share to the expression
of his countenance.</p>

<p>Nothing was ultimately wanting that could contribute
to the success of the Hamburg celebration. The first
concert, on September 25, was devoted to three of the
musical giants&mdash;Bach, Handel, Beethoven; that of the 26th
to Haydn, Mozart, Cherubini, Schumann, and, in memory
of the society's first conductor, W. Grund. The morning
of the 27th was given up to rehearsal&mdash;especially of Brahms'
new symphony, under the composer's direction; the afternoon,
to the excursion and banquet. Almost everyone had
come from everywhere. Besides those who were taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
part in the concerts there were Hiller, Gernsheim, Gade,
Reinecke, Reinthaler, Grimm, Flotow, Theodor Kirchner,
Verh&uuml;lst (from the Hague), Hanslick, Claus Groth, not to
mention Gr&auml;dener, of early days, and a host of old Hamburg
friends. Our master was in genial mood, and chatted gaily
with acquaintances old and new during the run down the
river, but a sign showed that his thoughts were with the
past. Claus Groth, who was placed at the banquet next to
Brahms, relates that the proposer of the composer's health
referred in his speech to the old proverb of the prophet's unworthiness
in his own country, and pointed out its inapplicability
in the case of the day's ceremony, 'when the society
unites with me in praise and love of our Johannes Brahms.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms turned to me,' continues Groth, 'and whispered
in a deep and serious tone, "This of my case! Twice
was the vacant conductor's post of the Philharmonic
Society given to a stranger whilst I was passed over. If it
had been offered me at the right time I should have become
a methodical citizen, and could have married and become
like other men. Now I am a vagabond!"'</p>

<p>That Brahms would under any circumstances have
summoned up sufficient courage to commit himself to the
irretrievable step of matrimony we may be permitted to
doubt. That one obstacle which prevented him was his
own fear of the interruption that such a change might cause
to his own almost too orderly and methodical habits is
fairly certain.</p>

<p>The boat started from Blankenese on its return journey
to St. Pauli's landing-bridge, Hamburg, at 9.30 p.m., and
at the moment of its departure three rockets were sent up
from deck and three shots fired from shore, by arrangement
with the inhabitants of the numerous villas that line the
bank of the Elbe, as a signal for the illumination of houses
and gardens, which accordingly gave graceful testimony
to the returning musicians of the widespread interest felt
in the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The third and concluding concert of the festival took place
on the evening of Sunday, September 29, with performances
of Weber's 'Oberon' overture, Songs by Schubert, Spohr's
Concertante for two violins, Brahms' second Symphony, under
his own direction, and Mendelssohn's 'Walpurgis Nacht.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The delight of the public at Brahms' symphony was
most enthusiastically expressed,' says Hanslick. 'Brahms,
who was received with orchestra flourish and laurel wreath,
himself conducted, and Joachim played first violin in the
orchestra. At the close of the symphony the ladies of the
chorus and in the first rows of the audience threw their
flowers to Brahms, who stood there, in the words of his
own cradle-song, "covered with roses."'</p>

<p>Ludwig Meinardus, of the <i>Hamburger Correspondenten</i>,
after giving a detailed and most appreciative account of
the several movements of the work, continues:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms himself conducted his symphony, which is
sealed with the stamp of immortality, in his native city
before an audience of thousands raised to festival pitch,
in which mingled a large number of musical authorities
from outside. The enthusiasm was increased by this circumstance,
and by the simplicity and quiet energy with
which Brahms handled the b&acirc;ton. It prepared for him an
ovation as he ascended the conductor's desk in the shape of
a big laurel wreath, a flourish, and a stormy welcome from
those upon and in front of the platform; it broke out after
each of the four movements, and increased at the close of
the third to a <i>da capo</i> demand to which the conductor and
composer only at length and with the reluctance of modesty
resolved to yield; it was expressed finally, at the close of
the work, by persistent recalls and by a rain of flowers
which poured from all sides upon the admired and revered
composer.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>The last few words seem to remind us of the early sixties,
and to bring us once more face to face with the Halliers,
V&ouml;lckers, Wagners, Fr&auml;ulein Laura Garbe, and other former
members of the ladies' choir, many of whom were still
resident in Hamburg, and, having retained their old affectionate
admiration of their young musician without a jot
of abatement as they watched his course during the passing
years, now brought affection, admiration, and sympathetic
triumph dressed in graceful guise to throw at the feet of
the famous master. Marxsen, prevented by considerations
of health from joining the excursion down the river, was
present at the concert, beaming with joy; B&ouml;ie, too, associated
with early performances of the B flat Sextet and the
G minor Pianoforte Quartet, was there, whilst the presence
of Christian Otterer, who had played viola as an old friend
at the subscription concert given by the youthful Hannes
at the 'Old Raven,' carried the associations of the evening
back almost to the year of the composer's birth. Two
names which we should gladly have included are missing
from the list of our old acquaintances. None would have
more heartily rejoiced in the events of the evening than
Friedrich Willibald Cossel, now some thirteen summers
passed away; and what may not be imagined of Jakob
Brahms' exultant pride had six more years of life been
spared him! We may picture the pursed-up lips, the
gratified expression of the eyes, the playful assumption of
dignity towards his own particular chums, the tears of joy
with which he would have answered Joachim's cordial
hand-grasp, the shy, gratified whisper to Carl Bade, 'Ik
segge nix' (I shall not speak), when some distinguished
musician or charming lady had desired to be introduced to
him as the father of his son. Frau Cossel was present with
her talented daughter Marie (Frau Dr. Janssen), and the old
family ties so treasured by our master were represented by
Elise and Fritz, and by kind Frau Caroline with her son
Fritz Schnack, who entertained an almost adoring affection
for his stepbrother. Frau Caroline was invariably present
at any concert in Hamburg in which Johannes took part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
by the composer's express desire. Elise begged her brother
after the concert for the wreaths that had been presented
to him.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'So you want to brag with them?' said he; 'come to
me early to-morrow morning; we will go together and lay
them on father's grave.'</p>

<p>It may be added here, for the sake of completeness, that
some time later, on von Bernuth's contemplated resignation,
a representative of the Philharmonic Society called on
Groth to ask his opinion as to the probability of Brahms'
acceptance of an offer of the conductorship. He pointed
out that the then committee could not justly be blamed
for the mistakes of their predecessors, which they were
anxious to repair as far as might now be possible, and Groth,
after discussing the matter in detail, consented to lay it
informally before Brahms. We cannot wonder that no
answer was received to his communication; it must seem
obvious to most minds that the master could neither accept
nor decline an offer which had not been made. Had the
committee decided to risk the slight mortification of a
refusal from Brahms by writing a definite proposal to him,
it is certain that he would have replied to it, though it seems
unlikely that he would have uprooted himself from the
city where he had formed intimate friendships now that
one of the principal attractions which Hamburg had
possessed for him&mdash;the presence of his parents&mdash;had ceased
to exist.</p>

<p>The publications of the year include, besides the Symphony
in D major, a set of 'Ballads and Romances' for
two voices, dedicated to Julius Allgeyer, the first of which
has the Scotch ballad 'Edward' for its text.</p>

<p>Of other early performances of the second symphony we
may mention those of October 22 in Breslau, under the
composer, and of November 23 in M&uuml;nster, under Grimm.
Such a furore was created in M&uuml;nster that the work was
repeated by general desire at the concert of December 21.</p>

<p>At the Vienna Gesellschaft concert of December 8, No. 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of the two Motets, Op. 74, for unaccompanied chorus was
sung, under the direction of Edward Kremser, from the
manuscript parts. All four movements, the first and last in
four, the second and third in six, parts, made a deep impression,
and in spite of the serious character of the work
it was followed by long-continued applause. The texts
have the characteristics usually preferred by Brahms for
his sacred compositions, and, taken together, are expressive
of courageous, trustful resignation in the face of mystery.
The music, exquisitely suited to the words, furnishes
another example of deeply serious feeling clothed in the
beautiful forms of early contrapuntal art.</p>

<p>Great interest was aroused in the musical circles of many
lands by the announcement that Joachim would play a
violin concerto by Brahms at the Leipzig Gewandhaus
concert of January 1, 1879. Such an event was bound
to raise a particular question, connected not only with
Brahms' musical career, but with the history of musical
art. Many concertos for violin solo with orchestral accompaniment
had been produced since the days of Viotti,
through those of Mozart and Spohr, down to the publication
in 1877 of Max Bruch's second in D minor, and, of the
most favoured, few had retained more than an occasional
place in concert-programmes. Two only had survived the
test of time as the pre-eminent masterpieces of their class;
those of Beethoven and Mendelssohn. If no work of the
kind could be placed exactly with Beethoven's Violin Concerto,
yet, even as compared with this supreme achievement,
no thought of inferiority could be applied to that of
Mendelssohn, which immediately on its production took
the place it had ever since held as one of two <i>chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i>.
The question which now naturally suggested itself was
whether Brahms' new work would take its place as a third
by the side of its two greatest predecessors. It was the
more interesting because, though the composer was not now
breaking essentially new ground, yet his one previous concerto
had been composed for the pianoforte, and whilst two
decades had elapsed since its completion in final form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
(Detmold, autumn of 1858), and first public performances
(Hanover and Leipzig, January, 1859), it bore distinct
traces of a still earlier period, with which we now know it
to have been associated. The experience of a life, therefore,
may almost be said to have intervened between the
two works.</p>

<p>Turning to our old friend D&ouml;rffel, already doubly proved
impartial, for his immediate impressions of the Gewandhaus
concert of January 1, we find his report very interesting
reading.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'No less a task,' he says, 'confronted Brahms, if his
salutation to his friend were to be one suitable to Joachim's
eminence, than the production of a work that should reach
the two greatest, Beethoven and Mendelssohn. We confess
to having awaited the solution with some heart palpitation,
though we firmly maintained our standard. But what
joy we experienced! Brahms has brought such a third
work to the partnership. The originality of the spirit
which inspires the whole, the firm organic structure in which
it is displayed, the warmth which streams from it, animating
the work with joy and light&mdash;it cannot be otherwise&mdash;the
concerto must be the fruit of the composer's latest and, as
we believe, happiest experiences.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The first movement is broad, with sharply defined contrasts
through which, however, the serious-soft mood is
preserved; the second is short, very thoughtful and fervent;
the last, very spirited and attractive. There is, however, a
quite unusual handling of the instrument, and again, a
breath in the orchestra, which make us look forward with
delight to the study of the score; we have seldom been so
enthralled by the composer's genius. But Joachim played,
also, with a love and devotion which brought home to us in
every bar the direct or indirect share he has had in the work.
As to the reception, the first movement was too new to be
distinctly appreciated by the audience, the second made
considerable way, the last aroused great enthusiasm.'</p>

<p>Bernsdorf was less unsympathetic than usual. He considered
the concerto 'one of the clearest and most spontaneous
of the composer's works.' Both Joachim and
Brahms, who conducted the orchestra, had to respond to
numerous recalls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Joachim, to whom the concerto is dedicated, brought the
manuscript with him to England, and performed it at the
Crystal Palace Saturday concert of February 22 (August
Manns), at the Philharmonic concerts of March 6 and 20
(W. G. Cusins), at some of his appearances in the north of
Britain, and, a little later, at a concert of the Royal Academy
of Arts, Berlin, when the accompaniment was played by
his school orchestra. Published in the course of the year,
it has ever since held a conspicuous place in his r&eacute;pertoire.
The violinists Brodsky and, a little later, Frau
Roeger-Soldat were amongst those who associated their
names in a special manner with the early life of the work,
which has recently been frequently performed with immense
success by Fritz Kreisler.</p>

<p>If the mood of this great concerto has, as Dr. Deiters
remarks, something in common with that of the second
symphony, the sentiment is maintained at a loftier height
than that of the earlier composition, the limpid grace of
which has an immediate fascination for a general audience.
The concerto requires time for full appreciation, and though,
by general consent of the initiated, it undoubtedly occupies
a position on the plane assigned to it by D&ouml;rffel, it would
be too much to assert that it has as yet entirely conquered
the heart of the great public. It is gradually making its
way, however, to what will probably become unreserved
popularity.</p>

<p>The year 1879 is of particular interest in our narrative,
not only in relation to the Violin Concerto, but also because
it included the publication of two books of Pianoforte
Pieces, Op. 76, the several numbers of which are entitled
'Intermezzo' or 'Capriccio'; and the first performance
from the manuscript of a Sonata for pianoforte and violin.
We have traced the remarkable continuity of Brahms'
development as a composer during the first ten years of his
connection with Vienna, in its relation to the period which
directly preceded his earliest visit to the city. The period
dating back from 1862 to 1852 is not so unbroken. Quite
another sequel than the actual one might have been anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
from the fact that of the first ten of the composer's
published works six had been pianoforte solos, five of them
in other than variation form. We have watched his progress
from one stepping-stone of excellence to another in
this form, from the early beauties of the examples contained
in the Sonatas, Op. 1 and Op. 2, through the astonishing
technical advance displayed in Op. 9, up to a masterpiece,
the Handel Variations and Fugue, Op. 24, and have still had
to add one more work to the list, the Paganini Variations,
with imposing characteristics of its own; but we have not
had to record the appearance of a single unaccompanied
pianoforte solo in any other form in the course of the twenty-five
years which succeeded the completion of the Ballades,
Op. 10, in 1854 (published in 1856). Only now when the
narrative has been brought to the point appropriate for
the contemplation of these facts is it possible to point out the
true significance to our master's career of the four years of
study passed in complete retirement by the composer, as
distinct from the pianist, Brahms, that followed the close of
1854. On his reappearance in 1859 and 1860 with a number
of new works, not only had his technique been reformed, and
transfigured, but the tendency of his career changed. The
fascination exercised over his mind by the pure style of
part-writing practised by the best masters of the early
Italian schools, and the extent of resource he had acquired
by constant assimilation of the treasure of Bach's learning,
had given him an irresistible bent towards the composition
of works that led up to the Requiem and Triumphlied on
the one hand, and the String Quartets and Symphonies on
the other; and the same influences would naturally dispose
him towards the writing of chamber music for pianoforte
and strings rather than for pianoforte alone. It is well
known that his innate fastidiousness in regard to his own
work was augmented in the case of his first symphony by
his never-ceasing consciousness of Beethoven's overwhelming
achievements in this domain; and his abstention, after
his earliest period, from the publication of a pianoforte
sonata may have been partially due to a similar, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
even stronger, feeling that Beethoven's sonatas cannot
be succeeded. It is, however, difficult to believe that
Brahms' would not have persevered and conquered&mdash;conquered
in the sense of producing something appropriate
to his time&mdash;in the one case as in the other if he had felt
a real impulse to do so, and it may possibly be true that his
genius was better suited for the forms in which he worked
than for those which he avoided.</p>

<p>The two books of Pianoforte Pieces, which, with the two
Motets, Op. 74, dedicated to Philipp Spitta, the Violin
Concerto, and the three Pianoforte Studies after Bach without
opus number, formed the publications of the year 1879,
contain, in all, eight numbers. Some of them, written with
simplicity of style and pervaded by a spirit of dreamy
content or graceful happiness, have become familiar to
music-lovers; others present difficulties both to listener
and performer which have hindered their popularity.
Several contain interesting examples of the composer's
facility in the art of rhythmic and contrapuntal device.</p>

<p>The Sonata for pianoforte and violin in G major, performed
from the manuscript by Brahms and Hellmesberger
at the Quartet concert of November 20, is a pearl of pure
and delicate imagination. The vivacity of the first movement
is painted in pale moonbeam tints, and must, as one
fancies, vanish before the first warm ray of sunshine. There
is more substantiality about the gentle melancholy of the
adagio, though this movement, again, is haunted by a strain
of mystery. The last movement, written in rondo form,
has for its first subject that of the beautiful 'Rain-Song'
already alluded to, and is a very dream of wistful charm.
Brahms' very original treatment of the pianoforte arpeggio,
which is one of the distinctive features of his style of writing
for the instrument, is well illustrated in the first movement
of this work, in which the arpeggio is raised from the mere
position of a brilliant passage to that of an essential part of
the entire conception. A particularly clear light is thrown
also upon the composer's relation to Bach by the study of
the sonata, the methods of which are inherited from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of the early giant-musician, as exemplified in his sonatas for
clavier and violin; and whilst Bach's methods flow as easily
within the forms of the Austrian masters as though they
had always been an inseparable part of them, the association
is animated by the distinctive individuality of our Brahms.
Not, however, as it impressed itself upon us in his first
great series of works for pianoforte and strings. The spirit
of the Sonata in G is essentially that of the master's later
period of maturity. In it we feel that he has not only his
powers, but his emotions, well in hand, and has reached a
period of life when he can afford to look back calmly to the
conflicts of the past. This no mere fancy; we find as we
proceed in the study of Brahms' art, not that the nature
of the man changed as he grew older, but that, whilst the
sunshine of complete recognition which brightened his later
path through life is felt in the clear spirit of some of his
works, the reserve which characterizes others is now dictated
by the complete self-mastery which it had been one of the
efforts of his life to attain, and which lends them a singular
and pathetic charm as of consciously half-revealed power
and beauty.</p>

<p>The Sonata in G major is the fourth composed by Brahms
for pianoforte and violin. The first, belonging to his first
period, had, as we know, been mysteriously lost on the eve
of publication. The second and third were rejected after
completion by the composer's relentless self-criticism, and
the manuscripts destroyed by his own hand. The publication
of this one, known as the first, took place quite at the
beginning of the year 1880, and the work was played with
immense success by Brahms and Joachim during a short
concert-tour they made together in the Austrian provinces
during the last week of January and the first of February.
In the course of his visit Joachim performed the Violin
Concerto at one of three orchestral concerts given by him
in the large hall of the Vienna 'Gesellschaft,' with the
result to be expected from the association of two names so
dear to the Austrian public.</p>

<p>The sonata was performed for the first time in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
at the Monday Popular concert of February 2 by von
B&uuml;low and Madame Norman-N&eacute;ruda, and at the Wednesday
Popular concert, Cambridge, on the 25th of the same
month by C. Villiers Stanford and Richard Gompertz. One
of the earliest performances in Germany was that by Scholz
and Himmelstoss at Breslau on February 24.</p>

<p>Brahms' first appearance at Crefeld on January 20 must
be particularly recorded for two reasons: in the first place
because it introduces us to a group of friends, his pleasant
associations with whom are commemorated in the dedication
of one of his later works. A considerable amount of music
was performed during this first visit, and more on subsequent
ones, in the informal, sociable way Brahms liked, at the
houses of Herr and Frau Rudolph von der Leyen, with
whom he always stayed, and of their relatives, Herr and
Frau Alwyn von Beckerath. Herr von Beckerath, a good
amateur performer, played viola in the resident string
quartet led by Professor Richard Barth, a former pupil of
Joachim, an old acquaintance of Brahms, and well known
later on as von Bernuth's successor at Hamburg, who was
always present with his colleagues at these private gatherings;
and the enjoyment of the circle was enhanced during
Brahms' later visits to Crefeld by the singing, to the master's
accompaniment, of Fr&auml;ulein Antonia Kufferath. This lady
(now Mrs. Edward Speyer) has interesting recollections
connected with the Crefeld visits. Amongst them is that
of Brahms, who when once a composition was published
allowed it to pass from his mind, sometimes almost completely,
coming unawares upon a difficult passage in the
accompaniment of one of his songs, and having an instant's
struggle with it. At the end he turned to Fr&auml;ulein Kufferath,
saying, 'That is really difficult to read at sight!'</p>

<p>The musical event which gives particular distinction to
the Crefeld concert of 1880, the programme of which
included Brahms' second Symphony, 'Harzreise' Rhapsody
and Triumphlied, was the performance by the composer
of two new solos for the pianoforte, the Rhapsodies in
B minor and G minor, generally accepted as the finest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Brahms' shorter works for the instrument. The second
one especially, marked 'molto passionato ma non troppo
allegro,' is an inspiration from beginning to end, and though
not long, its length is sufficient to balance its grandeur of
idea and to give the effect of completeness to its performance.
Billroth, to whom Brahms, always needing sympathy,
confided the manuscripts on their completion in the early
summer of 1879, returned them with the words:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The second piece has quite fascinated me. In both
pieces there is more of the young, heaven-storming Johannes
than in the other late works of the mature man.'</p>

<p>The Sonata in G, Op. 78, the Rhapsodies, Op. 79, and
the third and fourth books of Hungarian Dances for Pianoforte
Duet, without opus number, were the publications
of 1880.</p>

<p>It may have been noticed by the reader that, in our record
of the early performances of Brahms' works during the
closing seventies, no mention has been made of Munich.
The reason is not far to seek, and is such as might almost
have been anticipated. The time arrived when the paths
of Brahms and Levi separated, and its occurrence may be
definitely dated in November, 1876, when our master
visited Munich to conduct his first symphony, and stood
there for the last time on a concert platform.</p>

<p>The attraction felt by Levi towards Wagner's art and
personality had grown continually stronger since his preparation
of the 'Meistersinger' for performance at Carlsruhe
in 1869 and the establishment of personal relations between
himself and Wagner to which it led; and his enthusiasm
for the man and his works received extraordinary stimulus
from the first performances of the 'Nibelungen Ring,' at
which he was present, in the temporary theatre at Bayreuth
in August, 1876. The impulsive expression to Brahms
of his boundless admiration, carried beyond the point which
should have been prescribed by tact, seems to have convinced
our master that future relations between himself and
Levi would be embarrassing to both; and though he received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
his friend's outpourings without visible sign, he took the
wise and friendly course of abstaining from further visits
to Munich. Enough, it is hoped, has been related in these
pages of Brahms' appreciation of Wagner's powers to exclude
the suspicion that he was actuated by petty feeling in taking
this line. Levi's want of self-restraint was in one sense an
acknowledgment of the master's artistic generosity; but
compliments of this kind should not be carried to extremes,
and Brahms' courage in adhering to a course certain to
expose him to misunderstanding saved Levi as well as
himself from the danger of the false position which must
inevitably have threatened their future intercourse. The
wreath which Brahms sent to Bayreuth on Wagner's death
in February, 1883, was not the sign of a mere decorous
compliance with custom, but was a heart-felt tribute of
recognition from the one great master to the other.</p>

<p>Brahms' separation from Levi necessarily involved a
coolness between himself and Allgeyer, who was one of the
closest intimates of the Levi circle, but this was only temporary,
and was probably merely accepted by Brahms as
one of the incidents of the situation. It was got over during
a visit paid by Allgeyer to Vienna, and Brahms' pleasure
at the renewal of personal relations between himself and
his old friend may be read in the dedication of the 'Ballads
and Romances' published in 1878, to which reference has
already been made.</p>

<p>To Brahms' activity on the advisory committee for the
granting of Government stipendiums to young artists, combined
with the growing feeling of mental leisure which
must have come to him at this period of his mature mastership,
must be ascribed the willingness shown by him, from
the middle of the seventies onward, to concern himself with
the musical progress of certain young composers who were
courageous enough to ask his opinion and advice, and in
whose works he discerned talent. Mention has been made
of his prompt and emphatic appreciation of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k.
Amongst other musicians of distinction who in their youth
enjoyed the advantage of his interest and friendship are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Drs. Richard Heuberger, Eusebius Mandycweski (now
holding the important position of librarian to the Gesellschaft
der Musikfreunde), von Rottenberg, and Jenner. We
spoke in the last chapter of some of the incidents of the
master's friendship for Heuberger, who says that Brahms'
great talent for teaching became continually clearer to him.
'With gifted young people who had already passed through
the school curriculum, he might have achieved great things.'
His criticism was so ruthless and searching as to be at first
profoundly discouraging, but he could praise warmly, too,
and there was no mistaking the pleasure he felt in being
able to do so. His remarks to Heuberger, chiefly called
forth by points in the manuscripts&mdash;often songs&mdash;laid before
him, and by suggested improvements, usually served to
elucidate general principles. The close rhythmical association
of music with words, the conditions indispensable to
the admission of irregularity of bar rhythm, the construction
of melody, are but a few of the important points that
were handled in the brief, incisive, pregnant manner which
illumined every subject that he touched upon.</p>

<p>'Do you think,' said he one day, taking exception to an
expression inadvertently used by Heuberger apropos to
the construction of his melody, 'that any one of my half-dozen
passable songs "occurred" to me? I had to worry
myself with them rarely! One must be able&mdash;don't take
this literally&mdash;to <i>whistle</i> a song ... then it is good.'</p>

<p>'Those <i>must</i> have been eyes, but perhaps not so interesting
to other people,' he said, pointing to the too drawn-out
setting of the words 'I saw two eyes last Sunday morn,' in
one of Heuberger's manuscripts, and he improvised the
passage in the closer form which the composer has retained
in his published song 'Bitt' ihn o Mutter.'</p>

<p>The committee formed in 1871 to consider a scheme for
the erection of a monument to Schumann at Bonn had been
so successful during the few years following the festival
of 1873, in collecting funds for their object, that by the
beginning of May, 1880, the memorial, designed and executed
by the sculptor Donnhorf, had been placed over Schumann's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
grave in the Bonn cemetery, and nothing remained to be
done save to unveil and deliver it over to the municipal
authorities. These ceremonies were to be performed on
the 2nd of the month, and to be followed by some festival
concerts with programmes of the master's music.</p>

<p>Proceedings opened on the evening of May 1, when Frau
Schumann, arrived with some of her family on a visit to
her old friends the Kyllmanns, to whose house the reader
was introduced in an earlier chapter, was greeted by a
serenade, sung in the garden by the members of the Concordia
and the Academic Vocal Union, which was followed
by performances within doors of the 'Lotos Blume'
and the 'Traumender See.' President Wrede then delivered
an address, and on its conclusion introduced each member
of the societies individually to Frau Schumann. With her
permission, Herr Branscheidt sang two of Schumann's
songs to the accompaniment of Concertmeister Lorscheidt,
and after the great artist had acknowledged these compliments
in a few suitable words, the vocalists returned to the
garden to sing 'Thou in the wood hast wandered,' from
Schumann's 'Pilgrimage of the Rose.' With this performance
the programme of the evening terminated, and
after Frau Schumann had again expressed her warm thanks
the visitors withdrew.</p>

<p>The cemetery was crowded early the next day by friends
desirous of witnessing the unveiling of the monument.
Nearly twenty-four years had gone by since the simple
funeral procession had followed Schumann's remains through
the streets of Bonn; since a group of young musicians stood
together at the open grave, supported by the sympathy of
a concourse of friends and music-lovers, to take their last
farewell of the illustrious dead. Now they were reassembled
on the same spot to do honour to the beloved master's
memory. Not one was missing. Brahms, Joachim, Dietrich,
the three young chief mourners of the first occasion, stood
together again as middle-aged men; Hiller the older friend,
Grimm, and Bargiel, all were there, and Stockhausen, since
many years one of the circle. The central figure in to-day's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
proceedings had been absent, prostrated with sorrow, from
the funeral ceremony. Frau Schumann now stood with
her daughters at the foot of the monument, her usual
pathetic expression deepened by the rush of varied memories,
but with controlled demeanour. Amongst those present in
an official capacity were the mayor of Bonn, Herr Oberb&uuml;rgermeister
Doetsch; the sculptor, Professor Donnhorf,
from Dresden; the president of the memorial committee,
Professor Schaafhausen, and the members of the two choral
societies with President Wrede.</p>

<p>The singing of the fine old chorale, 'Was Gott thut das
ist wohlgethan' was the prelude to the address in which
Geheimrath Schaafhausen gave the monument over to the
city of Bonn. Whilst he was speaking the covering fell,
and as he concluded many beautiful wreaths were laid on
the grave to the accompaniment of a second chorale. An
address of thanks was delivered on behalf of the city by
Oberb&uuml;rgermeister Doetsch, and the singing of a third
chorale, with the placing of more wreaths, brought the
formalities to a close. The following telegram was handed
to the mayor in the course of the proceedings:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The Society of Music-lovers and the Conservatoire of
Vienna congratulate Bonn on the honour of having to-day
erected the first memorial to Schumann as previously that
to Beethoven.'</p>

<p>The programme of the orchestral concert which took place
in the evening of May 2, beginning at six o'clock, included
Schumann's E flat Symphony and Requiem for Mignon,
conducted by Brahms; a poetic 'Prologue,' composed and
recited by Herr Emil Ritterhaus of Barmen; the Manfred
music conducted by Joachim, with Ernst von Possart,
director of the court theatre of Munich, in the chief
declamatory part; and as single exception in the list of
Schumann's works, Brahms' Violin Concerto, conducted by
the composer, and played by Joachim in so perfect and
ideal a manner as to be, 'not merely interpretative, but
absolutely creative.' A rain of bouquets followed its conclusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Three works were given at the chamber music
concert of the following morning: Schumann's String
Quartet in A minor, led by Joachim; Spanisches Liederspiel;
and Quartet for pianoforte and strings, of which
Brahms and Joachim played the pianoforte and violin
parts respectively.</p>

<p>To this year is to be referred the composition of the only
two overtures published by Brahms. The 'Tragic,' the
grave character of which may be inferred from its title,
was performed for the first time in December at the fourth
concert of the Vienna Philharmonic season. Dr. Deiters
says of it:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'In this work we see a strong hero battling with an iron
and relentless fate; passing hopes of victory cannot alter
an impending destiny. We do not care to inquire whether
the composer had a special tragedy in his mind, or if so,
which one; those who remain musically unconvinced by the
unsurpassably powerful theme, would not be assisted by
a particular suggestion.'</p>

<p>The 'Academic Festival Overture' which we know, was
the one out of three selected by the composer for preservation.
It was composed in acknowledgment of the honorary
doctor's degree offered to Brahms in 1880 by the university
of Breslau, and was performed for the first time in that city
on January 4, 1881, under his direction. The companion
work, the Tragic Overture, and the second Symphony were
included in the same programme. The newly-made Doctor
of Philosophy was received with all the honour and enthusiasm
befitting the occasion and his work, and was again
stormily applauded on the 6th, when he performed Schumann's
Fantasia, Op. 17, his two Rhapsodies, and the
pianoforte part of his Horn Trio, at a concert of chamber
music.</p>

<p>In the Academic Overture the sociable spirit reappears
which had prompted the boy of fourteen to compose an
ABC part-song for his seniors, the village schoolmasters in
and around Winsen. Now the renowned master of forty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
seeks to identify himself with the youthful spirits of
the university with which he has become associated, by
taking, for principal themes of his overture, student melodies
loved by him from their association with the early G&ouml;ttingen
years of happy companionship with Joachim, with Grimm,
with von Meysenbug and others. Four of these, 'Wir
hatten gebauet,' 'H&ouml;rt ich sing' 'Was kommt dort,' and
the 'Gaudeamus,' are introduced in the course of the
movement, which is written in regular classical form, and
the composer lingers with particular affection over the third
one, the song that in student circles accompanies the merry
'Fox-ride,' which in the summer of 1853 carried Brahms so
many leagues distant from the earlier stages of his life's
journey. The favourite 'Gaudeamus igitur,' given with
the full strength of the orchestra, brings the masterly and
effective work to a brilliant conclusion. The two overtures,
bearing to each other a relation analogous to that which
exists between the first and second symphonies, furnish
another instance of the composer's occasional habit of
writing at once, or in quick succession, two works of the
same form animated by contrasted subjective qualities.
The 'Academic' has become very familiar to concert-goers,
and has, so far, attained to more universal popularity than
the impressive 'Tragic.'</p>

<p>Both works were performed from the manuscript, under
the composer's direction, at the Leipzig Gewandhaus concert
of January 13, but alike failed to make much impression.
If, however, Brahms felt any disappointment at the persevering
coldness evinced towards his art in the musical
metropolis of North Germany, he must have derived some
consolation from the success which attended the performances
of the Academic Overture and other works conducted by
him in M&uuml;nster on January 22 and in Crefeld on the 25th,
and by the warm welcome which awaited him in each of
the Dutch cities&mdash;Amsterdam, the Hague, Haarlem&mdash;which
he visited in the course of the same month. Holland,
distinguished musically by its early appreciation of Schumann's
art, was now repeating history by its enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
acceptance of that of Brahms. In each town where he
appeared he had opportunity to perceive how deeply
his music had taken root in the country. Of his many
distinguished Dutch friends may be mentioned the composer
Verhulst, a man of eminent parts and attractive
personality, who had enjoyed the friendship of Mendelssohn
and of Schumann. Brahms did not this winter fulfil
any public engagement at Utrecht, but he stayed there for
a day or two as the Engelmanns' guest, and did his share
of music-making in private. To one old habit he steadfastly
adhered during the visit, though it had little to do with art.
Every morning on returning from his early walk he made
his way to the nursery, and after a game of romps carried
one child or another on his shoulder down to breakfast. To
say the truth, this was not an unmixed pleasure to the little
ones, who were sometimes frightened at their elevation,
for the master's gait was not of the smoothest. His persevering
sociability, however, was generally rewarded in
the end by the confidence of the little ones in which he felt
such satisfaction.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find Liszt and Brahms crossing each
other's paths again in the month of February, after a long
interval of years that had been big with consequence, and
not only to the younger musician; since the triumph of
Wagner's art must for ever be associated with the name of
its first generous protagonist. The two men were brought
together by the occasion of a concert given in Budapest
by Hans von B&uuml;low, who, on arriving at the H&ocirc;tel Ungaria,
found Brahms staying there, probably by preconcerted
arrangement.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Tr&egrave;s cher unique,' writes Liszt to B&uuml;low on February 13;
'I have taken a slight cold, and in order not to spoil the
day and evening of to-morrow, must retire early to-night.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Pray express my affectionate thanks to Brahms, and
convey to him the invitation of Madame La Baronne E&ouml;toos
to luncheon to-morrow at 1 o'clock without ennui or
vexation. Quite the contrary. I shall arrive at the
H&ocirc;tel Ungaria at a quarter before one in order to conduct
you to Her Excellency's house.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>It no doubt afforded genuine satisfaction to the warm-hearted
von B&uuml;low to place his two friends on a passing
footing of sociability. He had already begun, in his new
position as capellmeister to Duke George of Saxe-Meiningen,
to which he had been appointed the previous year, to use the
increased influence at his command in the interests of our
master's art, and before the close of this his first season of
activity in the Thuringian capital, Brahms' first and second
symphonies and other works had been performed under
B&uuml;low's direction before a highly sympathetic audience at
the concerts of the court orchestra.</p>

<p>The two Overtures, and 'N&auml;nie,' to which we have yet
to refer in detail, were published in the course of 1881.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>A holiday taken with Billroth in Sicily in the early spring
was succeeded by Brahms' removal to summer quarters,
chosen this year at Pressbaum, near Vienna. Here he was
occupied with the composition of Schiller's 'N&auml;nie,' to which
Feuerbach's death had moved him, and of a second concerto
for pianoforte and orchestra in B flat. The manuscripts of
'N&auml;nie' and of portions of the concerto were soon lent to
Billroth, the concerto movements being handed to him with
the words, 'A few little pianoforte pieces.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It is always a delight to me,' writes Billroth, 'when
Brahms, after paying me a short visit, during which we have
talked of indifferent things, takes a roll out of his palet&ocirc;t
pocket and says casually "Look at that and write me what
you think of it."'</p>

<p>The composer was pleasantly disturbed in August from
his quietly busy life by a visit from Widmann, who was
staying in Vienna, and who thus describes his meeting with
the friend he had not met for three years:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Walking through the garden, I came upon the master
sitting reading at an open window on the ground floor of his
idyllic dwelling, and at once instinctively felt that he had
entered upon a period of his career when there could be no
longer any thought of his commencing upon an entirely new
domain of his art [opera]. It may sound absurd when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>confess that the splendid, already slightly grizzled beard in
which I saw him for the first time, and scarcely recognised
him, seemed to me a symbol of the great composer's present
personality, now entirely self-adequate and perfectly defined
and assured within its own limits. I was so completely
dumbfoundered, however, by the surprise of seeing this
Jupiter head that a question burst from me as to the reason
of the alteration. "One is taken for an actor or a priest
if one is clean shaven," answered Brahms, complacently
stroking the flowing beard. He now had a na&iuml;ve satisfaction
in his own appearance, and smilingly mentioned that his
photograph with beard had been used in the Velhagen and
Clasing school book edition to illustrate the Caucasian type....
The opera project was not mentioned....'<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Brahms accepted numerous invitations from Germany,
Switzerland, and Holland to take part in performances of his
new works. He had for some time relaxed his early caution,
and was now generally ready to introduce his compositions
to the public on their completion, though adhering to his old
custom of retaining possession of the manuscript of an
important work for his own benefit until after its first
performances, when he allowed the business of engraving to
proceed without delay.</p>

<p>The new Pianoforte Concerto was played by the composer
in Stuttgart on November 22 (Court Capellmeister Seyfrix)
first time; in Meiningen on the 27th; Z&uuml;rich, Breslau,
Vienna (Philharmonic), respectively December 6, 20, 26;
Leipzig, Hamburg (Philharmonic), Berlin (Meiningen
orchestra), Kiel, Bremen, Hamburg (Meiningen orchestra),
M&uuml;nster, Utrecht, in January, and Frankfurt in February,
1882. The work was received with immense enthusiasm
throughout the tour, excepting at Leipzig, where it achieved
only a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>.</p>

<p>During his visit to Meiningen, Brahms was the guest of the
reigning Duke George and his consort, the Baroness von
Heldburg. Three fine rooms <i>en suite</i> on the ground-floor of
the castle were placed at his disposal, and in the most
spacious of them, arranged as a music-room, one of the Duke's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
fine Bechstein pianofortes had been placed. The apartment,
having direct access to the castle grounds, afforded the
composer easy opportunity to indulge in his favourite
recreation of walking.</p>

<p>B&uuml;low had left nothing undone that could contribute
&eacute;clat to his friend's first public appearance in Meiningen,
which he heralded a few days beforehand by giving a performance
of the German Requiem at an extra concert of the
court orchestra. The concert-hall was completely filled on
the evening of the 27th, and on the arrival of the Duke of
Saxe-Meiningen and the Baroness von Heldburg, accompanied
by Cardinal Prince Hohenlohe, the opening number
of the Brahms programme, the Tragic Overture, was
listened to by a breathlessly expectant audience. The
first glimpse of the composer as he advanced to the platform
to play the solo of the new Pianoforte Concerto in B flat
caused an outburst of welcome which made it impossible
for him to take his seat immediately, and the enthusiasm,
growing with each movement, reached its climax at the end.
'Brahms and B&uuml;low transported the audience to a state of
exaltation,' wrote the critic next day. The Haydn Variations
closed the first part of the concert; the second part,
consisting of the C minor Symphony and the Academic
Overture, was conducted by the composer. On its termination
the Duke expressed his appreciation by decorating
Brahms with the cross of his family order.</p>

<p>The visit to Meiningen marked the beginning of a cordial
friendship between the art-loving prince and his consort
on one hand and Brahms on the other, which brought many
pleasant hours to the great musician. He always stayed at
the castle when at Meiningen, where he was the centre of
many private musical gatherings. Several times he was a
guest at the castle of Altenstein, the Duke's country residence.
Here, as at Meiningen, he was allowed perfect
freedom of action, could work without fear of disturbance,
take solitary walks in the neighbourhood, or saunter in the
grounds in company, and was even permitted to retain his
very unconventional style of dress during the day. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
evening he recognised the claims of ceremonial custom, and
actually seemed to take a kind of pleasure in dressing for
dinner and wearing his decorations. He did not abate one
jot, however, of his usual independent expression of opinion,
and would defend his own point of view with characteristic
bluntness and tenacity no matter who might happen to
differ from him. An instance of this trait, as well as of his
singular political acumen, of interest at the present time,
occurred at the beginning of the war between China and
Japan. Brahms declared his belief, which was not shared
by others present, in the ultimate success of Japan, and
angrily anticipated the injustice by which the selfish interference
of the Western Powers would deprive her of the
fruits of victory. The Duke's answer, which reminded him
that European interests were involved in the question, left
him gruffly unconvinced, but the incident was allowed to
pass.</p>

<p>It was not only by his illustrious host that the composer
came to be loved. He made himself a favourite with everyone
in the Duke's service with whom he came in contact;
his visits to Meiningen and Altenstein Castles were regarded
by the entire household as a distinction and pleasure, and
the harmless jokes and playful sayings in which he continued
to find a childlike satisfaction to the end of his
life are remembered by these friends with affection and
regret.</p>

<p>The concert at Z&uuml;rich on December 6, the programme of
which included the first performance of 'N&auml;nie,' made an
extraordinary impression, and was so brilliantly successful
financially that, in the words of Steiner,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'the committee could not rest satisfied without giving visible
and lasting expression to their feelings of gratitude and
veneration towards the author of such glorious achievements.'</p>

<p>It took the form of a silver cup, designed for the occasion
by Bosshard of Lucerne, and was forwarded to the master
on its completion. Brahms wrote his thanks to Hegar in
the following words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Most Esteemed Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Your goblet has arrived, and the &eacute;tui containing the

<p class="blockquot">'But now, please, use your best words to assure your
esteemed fellow members of the great pleasure they have
given me and how grateful I am for their kindness. You
can easily supply details which I am shy of adding and which,
if written, might sound trivial and vain. You, however,
are aware that such a friendly token of appreciation and
sympathy is a very serious matter....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Now, with hearty greeting to you and yours,</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right:10em">'Yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right:10%;">'<span class="smcap">J. Brahms</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In his setting of 'N&auml;nie,' dedicated to Frau Henriette
Feuerbach and performed from the manuscript at this
concert, Brahms has conceived the calm fatalistic spirit of
classical antiquity represented in Schiller's funeral dirge
as perfectly as he has embodied in the music of the German
Requiem the passionate intensity of the writers of the Old
and New Testaments. A current of tender pathos glides
evenly through the lament, which is somewhat strengthened
during the passing image of Aphrodite bewailing the loss
of her son, but not sufficiently to disturb the smooth onward
flow of the passages proceeding continuously from beginning
to end of the work. It seems to suggest the ancient Greek
idea of death as the final decree of destiny, hardly to be
dreaded, not to be questioned or resisted, immutable even
in the presence of beauty, just as clearly as the powerful
contrasts of the Requiem present the Biblical conception
of death as an enemy to be opposed and finally destroyed in
the victory of an all-conquering love.</p>

<p>Dr. Carl Neumann describes a visit paid by him to Frau
Feuerbach when she was seventy-five years of age, at her
house in Ansbach. He went through two rooms.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'In the first was a grand piano on which lay Brahms'
"N&auml;nie"; in the second, one might say, dwelt the departed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>Tall green plants stood in the window recesses obscuring
the light. What the mother had of her son's works hung on
the walls. The coloured sketch of a "Descent of the Cross,"
a flower study belonging to the time when the frame of
"Plato's Feast" was painted, a drawing of the standing
Iphigenia looking towards the land of Greece&mdash;here was her
altar....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'We left this room. She sat down to the piano, at first
as if to rest; then asked if I knew Brahms' "N&auml;nie,"
which, as an admirer of her son's art, he had dedicated to her.
She gave me the music to follow and began to play it by
heart....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Suddenly I looked up.... The woman at the piano in
the black dress, a black veil on her white hair, seemed
changed. The tall figure, bent forward and lost in tones
and memories; was it not the tragic muse herself and was
she not sounding a song of fate?</p>

<p class="blockquot">'In the spring of 1886 she once again met Brahms and
heard "N&auml;nie" under Joachim.'<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The want of appreciation of the new concerto shown by
the audience of the Leipzig Gewandhaus did not escape the
notice of Hans von B&uuml;low in his capacity as Brahms'
champion, and he carried his band to Leipzig in the middle
of March to give a series of three concerts, two of them
respectively devoted to Beethoven and Brahms, and the
other divided between Mendelssohn and Schumann. The
Brahms programme included the C minor Symphony,
Haydn Variations, and the D minor Concerto played by
B&uuml;low, the orchestra accompanying without a conductor.
The applause which followed the movements of the symphony
as the work proceeded was not hearty enough to
satisfy the excitable capellmeister, who at the end of the
third movement desired his orchestra to repeat it, and on
the conclusion of the work turned round and addressed his
audience. He had, he said, arranged the Brahms programme
by express command of his Duke, who had desired
that the Leipzig public should know how the symphony
ought to be performed; and also to obtain satisfaction for
the coldness manifested towards the composer on his appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
with the new concerto at the Gewandhaus on January 1.
It need hardly be said that eccentric efforts such as this on
the part of a musician for many years conspicuously identified
with the New-German school could have no result one
way or the other in directing the artistic leanings of the city.</p>

<p>Brahms' Pianoforte Concerto in B flat is of quite unusual
dimensions, and differs not only from his first in D minor,
but from almost every other preceding work of its kind, in
containing four movements, the additional one of which, a
long 'allegro appassionato,' succeeds immediately to the
first allegro. Probably few hearers of the work would
subscribe to the reason for this innovation given by the
composer to his friend Billroth.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'When I asked him about it, he said that the opening
movement appeared to him too simple; he required something
strongly passionate before the equally simple
andante.'</p>

<p>If anything of the usual meaning of the word 'simple' is
to be attached to its use here&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, something without complication
and easy of comprehension&mdash;it must be said that
the second movement of the concerto, in spite of its passionate
character, is very much simpler than the first. Its
plan, whilst containing points of originality, is perfectly
symmetrical, and stands out in well-balanced proportions
clearly evident to the imagination.</p>

<p>The first movement, on the other hand, is extraordinarily
difficult to grasp as a whole, partly on account of its great
length, but still more from the ambiguity of the r&ocirc;le
assigned to the solo instrument on its entry after the first
orchestral 'tutti.' The principle to be traced in the first
movements of the concertos of Mozart and Beethoven, by
giving to the solo, on each entry, something of the character
of a brilliant improvisation, supported by the band, on the
material of a preceding 'tutti,' insures for it a clearly
defined position, and, whilst preserving a due balance
between the orchestra and the solo instrument, lends
contrast to the movement as a whole. Brahms would almost
seem, in the instance under consideration, to have deliberately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
degraded the pianoforte from its legitimate position as dominant
factor in its own domain. True, it enters with eight
bars' quasi-improvisatory restatement of the principal
theme, but it sinks immediately afterwards to occupy the
subordinate r&ocirc;le of the answering voice in a kind of antiphonal
duet with the orchestra, which it imitates almost
servilely, fragment by fragment, during a lengthy succession
of bars. This method of treatment robs the solo, not only
of its effect, but almost of its very <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, and, by
blurring the outline of the movement, is probably chiefly
answerable for the sense of fatigue, to which even Billroth
confessed, that most people feel after listening to a performance
of the entire work. This is not the place for a
detailed discussion of the movement, which, with all its
grandeur, scarcely realizes the great expectations warranted
by its magnificent opening. A comparison of it with the
first movement of Beethoven's Pianoforte Concerto in E flat
will make the foregoing remarks clear, the more so as the
ground-plan is much the same in the two compositions.
The third and fourth movements of Brahms' concerto are
as easy to follow as the second. The andante is fervent
and melodious, and the finale offers to the ear a dainty feast
of sound sparkling from beginning to end with graceful
vivacity.</p>

<p>This concerto has, like its predecessor, sometimes been
described as a symphony with pianoforte obligato. The
comparison is in each case misleading. Both works are
essentially based on the modern concerto form as established
by Mozart.</p>

<p>The Concerto in B flat, published in 1882, was dedicated
by Brahms to 'his dear friend and teacher Edward Marxsen.'
It was performed&mdash;probably for the first time in England&mdash;by
Charles Hall&eacute; at one of the famous Manchester concerts,
and by Heinrich Barth at a Crystal Palace Saturday concert
of November, 1884. The present author played it in London
December 13, 1888, at her matin&eacute;e at Messrs. Broadwood's,
and on February 14, 1891, at her private concert at the
Royal Academy of Music, kindly accompanied in the composer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
arrangement of the orchestral part for two pianofortes,
on the first occasion by Mr. Otto Goldschmidt and
Mr. Stephen Kemp, and on the second by Messrs. Stephen
Kemp and Septimus Webbe. Frederic Lamond introduced
it to the audience of the Philharmonic Society, St. James's
Hall, on May 14, 1891. Since these dates the concerto has
been frequently played in Great Britain by Leonard Borwick.
Fr&auml;ulein Marie Baumeyer of Vienna was the first lady to
perform the immensely difficult work. She played it in
Graz in 1883, and later, in the composer's presence, at one
of her concerts in Vienna.</p>

<p>The other publications of 1882 were a book of Romances
and Songs for one or for two voices, and two books of Songs
for one voice. The two Overtures and 'N&auml;nie' were issued
in 1881.</p>

<p>Brahms passed a considerable part of the first quarter of
1882 in Hamburg, to the joy of his friends there. He had
written in good time to Frau Caroline to bespeak his favourite
'corner room,' and made his headquarters from the beginning
of January with his stepmother. He had accepted an
invitation to conduct his Requiem at the annual Good
Friday concert of sacred music at the Stadt Theater, and
was occupied several weeks beforehand with preliminary
study and rehearsals. The choir of 200 consisted of the
members of the Bach Society and opera chorus combined.
The performance, which took place on April 7, partook of
the character of a solemn memorial service, and the audience
properly abstained from applause, though the sixth number
created an impression that would make itself audible. At
the close of the concert the composer received a vote of
cordial thanks tendered in the name of all present.</p>

<p>The master stayed, for the second time, at Ischl during
the summer months. Billroth, who was in the neighbourhood,
writes of him in August:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I should like to enjoy myself in Italy from September 15
till October 1. Brahms wishes to accompany me....
He has been very busy lately. Three books of songs have
been published. A string quintet and a trio are ready,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>both of them simpler, shorter, brighter than his earlier
things; he strives consciously for shortness and simplicity.
He lately sent me the manuscript of a true work of art, the
"Parzenlied" [Song of the Fates] from Goethe's "Iphigenia."
Very deep but simple.'</p>

<p>The journey to Italy duly took place, the proposed party
of two being enlarged to one of four by the addition of Ignaz
Br&uuml;ll and Simrock. Original plans had to be modified on
account of the exceptionally wet season, and the chief places
visited were Vicenza, Padua, and Venice.</p>

<p>The personnel of Brahms' intimate friends in Vienna had
remained on the whole much what it had become a very few
years after his arrival in the Austrian capital. Of its closest
circle the Fabers, Billroths, and Hanslicks, with whom must
be associated Joachim's cousins, the various members of the
Wittgenstein family&mdash;amongst them Frau Franz and Frau
Dr. Oser&mdash;still formed the nucleus. An acquaintance with
Herr Victor von Miller zu Aichholz and his wife had meanwhile
ripened into warm friendship, and their house became
one of those whose hospitality was most frequently and
gladly accepted by the master. Amongst the musicians,
Carl Ferdinand Pohl, author of the standard Life of Mozart,
and, since 1866, archivar to the Gesellschaft, was one of his
dearest friends. With the leading professors of the conservatoire
his relations continued very cordial, and amongst
the younger musicians to whom, in addition to his early
allies, Goldmark, G&auml;nsbacher and Epstein, he extended his
friendly regard, may be mentioned Anton Door and Robert
Fuchs. The feeling of warm friendship existing between
Brahms and Johann Strauss has been commemorated in
several well-known anecdotes. The autumn of 1881, however,
brought to permanent residence in Vienna a family that
before long made notable addition to the master's intimate
circle. Special circumstances conduced to the speedy
formation of a bond of friendship between Brahms and the
new-comers, Dr. and Frau Fellinger. In the first place,
they were friends of Frau Schumann and her daughters,
and as such had an instant claim on his courtesy, which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>acknowledged by calling on them as soon as possible after
their arrival. In the second, his interest was awakened by
the fact that Frau Dr. Fellinger was the daughter of Frau
Professor Lang-K&ouml;stlin, the gifted Josephine Lang, whose
attractive personality and talent for composition made a
strong impression upon Mendelssohn when he was a youth of
twenty-one and some six years the lady's senior. The story
of Josephine, who at the age of twenty-six married Professor
K&ouml;stlin of T&uuml;bingen, is given in Hiller's 'Tonleben,' and
Mendelssohn's congratulations to her bridegroom-elect may
be read in the second volume of the 'Letters.' The talent
for art which had come to her as a family inheritance was
transmitted to her daughter, though with a difference.
Frau Dr. Fellinger's gifts have associated themselves especially
with the plastic arts; in the first place with that of
painting, but they have become well known in the musical
world also by her busts and statuettes of Brahms, Billroth,
and others belonging to their circle. Her photographs of
our master are now familiar to most music-lovers. When it
is added that Brahms found he could command in Dr. Fellinger's
hospitable house, not only congenial intellectual
sympathy, but the unceremonious intercourse with a simple,
affectionate family circle in which he had through life found
a pre-eminent source of happiness, it will easily be understood
that he became a more and more frequent guest there, until,
during the closing years of his life, it became for him almost
a second home.</p>

<p>The master introduced two of his new works in the course
of a few weeks' journey undertaken in the winter of
1882-83. According to Simrock's Thematic Catalogue, the
Pianoforte Trio in C major, the String Quintet in F major,
and the 'Parzenlied' constitute the publications of 1883.
Early copies of the trio and quintet were sent out, however,
and the works were publicly performed from them in
December, 1882. An interesting entry in Frau Schumann's
diary says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I had invited Koning and M&uuml;ller to come and try
Brahms' new trio with me on Thursday 21st [December].
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>Who should surprise us as we were playing it&mdash;he himself!
He came from Strassburg and means to stay with us for
Christmas. I played the trio first and he repeated it.'</p>

<p>Both works were performed on December 29 at a Museum
chamber music concert&mdash;the Quintet by the Heermann-M&uuml;ller
party, the Trio by Brahms, Heermann, and M&uuml;ller.</p>

<p>Amongst the early performances of the Trio were those on
January 17 and 22 respectively in Berlin (Trio Concerts:
Barth, de Ahna, Hausmann) and London (Monday Popular
Concerts: Hall&eacute;, Madame N&eacute;ruda, Piatti), and at Hellmesberger's
in Vienna on March 15.</p>

<p>The work has not become one of the most generally
familiar of the master's compositions, though it is not easy
to say why. It contains no trace of the 'heaven-storming
Johannes,' but, like many of the later compositions, it
breathes, and especially the first movement, with a rich,
mellow warmth suggestive of one to whom the experiences
of life have brought a solution of their own to its problems,
which has quieted, if it has not altogether satisfied, the
aspirations and impulses of youth.</p>

<p>The Quintet in F for strings is, for the most part, bright,
concise, and easy to follow. As one of its special features
may be mentioned the combination of the usual two middle
movements in the second. It was given in Hamburg on
the 22nd and in Berlin on the 23rd of January, respectively
by Bargheer and Joachim and their colleagues (it should
be noted that Hausmann had at this time succeeded M&uuml;ller
as the violoncellist of the Joachim Quartet), at Hellmesberger's
on February 15, and at the Monday Popular,
London, of March 5.</p>

<p>Brahms conducted the first performance of the Parzenlied
in Basle on December 8, 1882. Excellently sung by the
members of the Basle Choral Society, the work met with
extraordinary success, and was repeated after the New Year
by general desire. Similar results followed its performance
in other towns, of which Strassburg and Crefeld should be
specially mentioned. The programme of the Crefeld concert
included the fifth movement of the Requiem. 'What is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
your <i>tempo</i>?' Brahms inquired, on the morning of the rehearsal,
of Fr&auml;ulein Antonia Kufferath, who was to sing the
solo. The lady, not taking the question seriously from the
composer of the music, waived a reply. 'No, I mean it;
you have to hold out the long notes. Well, we shall understand
each other,' he added; 'sing only as you feel, and I
will follow with the chorus.'</p>

<p>These are characteristic words, and valuable in more than
one sense. To most of the few works to which the master
has placed metronome indications&mdash;and the Requiem is
amongst these&mdash;he added them by special request, and
attached to them only a limited importance. An absolutely
and uniformly 'correct' pace for a piece of genuine music
does not exist. The pace must vary to some extent according
to subtle conditions existent in the performer, and the
instinct of a really musical executant or conductor will, as
a rule, be a safer guide, within limits, than what can be at best
but the mechanical markings even of the composer himself.</p>

<p>The Parzenlied, received with enthusiasm throughout
Brahms' tour in Germany and Switzerland, was not equally
successful in Vienna, where it was heard for the first time at
the Gesellschaft concert of February 18 under Gericke. The
austere simplicity of the music, which paces majestically
onward with the concentrated, resigned calm of despair,
adds extraordinary force to Goethe's poem, but does not
appeal to every audience, and the work has never become a
prime favourite in the Austrian Kaiserstadt. The song is
set for six-part chorus with orchestra, in plainer harmonic
masses and with less employment of imitative counterpoint
than we usually find in the works of Brahms, who has accommodated
his music here, as in 'N&auml;nie,' to the classical spirit
of the text. A singular deviation, however, which occurs
in the course of the setting, from the uncompromising
severity of the words, furnishes a remarkable illustration of
the composer's unconquerable idealism. Comment was
made in its place on the beautiful device by which
he has sought to relieve the dark mood of H&ouml;lderlin's
'Song of Destiny'&mdash;the addition of an instrumental postlude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
which breathes forth a message of tender consolation
that the poet could hardly have rendered in words. In
Schiller's 'N&auml;nie' the lament, with all its calm, gives expression
to a sentiment of compassionate sorrow that is
perfectly reproduced in the master's music. Goethe's Fates,
however, in their measured recitation of the gods' relentless
cruelty, would have seemed to offer no possible opportunity
for even the inarticulate expression of ruth. Least of all,
it might be imagined, could any concession to the demands
of the human heart have been found in the penultimate
stanza of their song:</p>

<p class="lyrics">
'The rulers exclude from<br />
Their favouring glances<br />
Entire generations,<br />
And heed not in children<br />
The once so belov&egrave;d<br />
And still speaking features<br />
Of distant forefathers.'
</p>

<p>Our Brahms, however, who, in spite of his increasing
weight, his shaggy beard, his frequently rough manners, his
unsatisfied affections, his impenetrable reserve, remained at
fifty, in his heart of hearts, the very same being whom we
have watched as the loving child of seven, the simple-minded
boy of fourteen, the broken-hearted man of thirty, sobbing
by the death-bed of his mother, cannot leave the dread gloom
of his subject unrelieved by a single ray. He seems, in his
setting of the last strophe but one, to concentrate attention on
past kindness of the gods, and thus, perhaps, subtly to suggest
a plea for present hope. How far the musician was justified
in thus wandering from the obvious intention of his poet
must be left to each hearer of the work to determine for himself.
If it be the case, as has sometimes been suggested,
that the variation was made by the composer in the musical
interests of the piece as a work of art, it cannot be held to
have fulfilled its purpose; for the striking inconsistency
between words and music in the verse in question has a
disturbing effect on the mind of the listener. We believe,
however, that the true explanation of the master's procedure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
is more radical, and is to be found in the nature of the man
in which that of the musician was grounded.</p>

<p>The Parzenlied was dedicated to 'His Highness George,
Duke of Saxe-Meiningen,' and was included in a Brahms
programme performed in Meiningen on April 2 to celebrate
the Duke's birthday. The complete breakdown of B&uuml;low's
health necessitated his temporary retirement from his conductor's
duties, which were divided on this occasion between
Brahms and Court Capellmeister Franz Mannst&auml;dt, appointed
to assist B&uuml;low. Returning by a circuitous route to
Vienna after a few days at the ducal castle, Brahms paid a
short visit to Hamburg to take part in another Brahms
programme arranged by the talented young conductor of
the Cecilia Society, Julius Spengel. This was the first of
several occasions on which the master gave testimony of his
appreciation of Dr. Spengel's talents and musicianship by
co-operating in the concerts of the society.</p>

<p>Brahms celebrated his fiftieth birthday by entertaining his
friends Faber, Billroth, and Hanslick at a bachelor supper.
He was occupied during the summer with the completion of
a third symphony, on which he had worked the preceding
year, and lived at Wiesbaden in a house that had belonged
to the celebrated painter Ludwig Knaus, in whose former
studio&mdash;Brahms' music-room for the nonce&mdash;the work was
finished.</p>

<p>It was known to the composer that a delicate elderly lady
inhabited the first-floor of the house of which Frau von
Dewitz's flat, where he lodged, formed an upper story.
Every night, therefore, on returning to his rooms, he took
off his boots before going upstairs, and made the ascent in
his socks, so that her rest should not be disturbed. This
anecdote is but one amongst several of the same kind that
have been related to the author by Brahms' intimate
associates. Samples of another variety should not, however,
be omitted.</p>

<p>A private performance of the new symphony, this time
arranged for two pianofortes, was given as usual at Ehrbar's
by Brahms and Br&uuml;ll, and aroused immense expectations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
for the future of the work. Amongst the listeners was a
musician who, not having hitherto allowed himself to be
suspected of a partiality for the master's art, expressed his
enthusiastic admiration of the composition. 'Have you
had any conversation with X?' young Mr. Ehrbar asked
Brahms; 'he has been telling me how delighted he is with
the symphony.' 'And have you told him that he very often
lies when he opens his mouth?' angrily retorted the composer,
who could never bring himself to submit to the humiliation
of accepting a compliment which he suspected&mdash;perhaps
unjustly in this case&mdash;of being insincere.</p>

<p>A terrible rebuff was administered by him on the evening
of a first Gewandhaus performance. It must be owned that
Brahms was seldom in his happiest mood when on a visit to
Leipzig; he was well aware that his music was not appreciated
within the official 'ring' there, and suspiciously
resented any well-meant efforts made to ignore this fact.
'And where are you going to lead us to-night, Herr Doctor?'
inquired one of the committee a few minutes before the
beginning of the concert, assuming a conciliatory manner
as he smoothed on his white kid gloves; 'to heaven?' 'It
is the same to me where you go,' rejoined Brahms.</p>

<p>The first performance of the Symphony in F major (No. 3)
took place in Vienna at the Philharmonic concert of December
2, under Hans Richter, who was, according to Hanslick,
originally responsible for the name 'the Brahms Eroica,'
by which it has occasionally been called. Whether or not
the suggestion is happy, a saying of the kind, probably
uttered on the impulse of the moment, should not be taken
very seriously.</p>

<p>Nothing of the quiescent autumn mood which we have
observed in the master's chamber music of this period is to
be traced in either of his symphonies, and the third, like its
companions, represents him in the zenith of his energies,
working happily in the consciousness of his absolute command
over the resources of his art. Whether it be judged by
its effect as an entire work or studied movement by movement,
whether each movement be listened to as a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
or analyzed into its component parts, all is found to be
without halt of inspiration or flaw in workmanship. Each
theme is striking and pregnant, and, though contrasting with
what precedes it, seems to belong inevitably to the movement
and place in which it occurs, whilst the development
of the thematic material is so masterly that to speak of
admiring it seems almost ridiculous. The last movement
closes with a very beautiful and distinctive Brahms coda.
The third symphony is more immediately easy to follow than
the first, and of broader atmosphere than the second. It
is of an essentially objective character, and belongs absolutely
to the domain of pure music.</p>

<p>The supreme and glorious pre-eminence which the great
master had by this time attained in contemporary estimation
naturally made it an object of competition with concert-givers
and directors to announce the earliest performances
of his works, and this was especially the case in the rare event
of a new symphony which succeeded its immediate predecessor
after an interval of six years. Brahms, however, had
his own ideas on this matter, as on every other that he
thought important, and after the first performance of the
work in Vienna he sent the manuscript to Joachim in
Berlin, and begged him to conduct the second performance
when and where he liked. This proceeding would hardly
have been noteworthy under the circumstances of intimate
friendship which had so long united the two musicians, had
it not been that the old relation between Brahms and
Joachim had been clouded during the past year or two,
during which there had been a cessation of their former
affectionate intercourse. When, therefore, it became known
that Joachim, acting on the composer's wish, proposed to
conduct the symphony at one of the subscription concerts
of the Royal Academy of Arts, Berlin, so much disappointment
and heart-burning were felt and expressed that
Joachim, although he had already replied in the affirmative
to Brahms' request, consented to write again and ask what
his wishes really were. The answer came without delay,
and was clear enough to set the matter quite at rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Brahms desired that the performance should be committed
unreservedly to the care of his old friend.</p>

<p>The symphony was heard for the second time, therefore,
on January 4 under Joachim at Berlin, and was enthusiastically
received by all sections of the public and press. It
was given again three times during the same month in the
German imperial capital under the composer's b&acirc;ton.</p>

<p>Detailed description of the triumphant progress of the new
work from town to town is no longer necessary. The composer
was overwhelmed with invitations to conduct it from
the manuscript, and B&uuml;low, convalescent from his illness,
and determined not to be outdone in enthusiasm, placed it
twice, as second and fourth numbers, in a Meiningen programme
of five works. On publication, it was performed in
all the chief music-loving towns of Germany, Great Britain,
Holland, Russia, Switzerland, and the United States.</p>

<p>In an account of a performance of the symphony at a
Hamburg Philharmonic concert under Brahms in December,
which followed one under von Bernuth after three weeks'
interval, the critic of the <i>Correspondenten</i> says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms' interpretation of his works frequently differs so
inconceivably in delicate rhythmic and harmonic accents
from anything to which one is accustomed, that the apprehension
of his intentions could only be entirely possible to
another man possessed of exactly similar sound-susceptibility
or inspired by the power of divination.'</p>

<p>The author feels a peculiar interest in quoting these lines,
which strikingly corroborate the impression formed by her
on hearing this and other of Brahms' works played under his
own direction.</p>

<p>The publications of 1884 were, besides the third Symphony,
Two Songs for Contralto with Viola and Pianoforte, the
second being the 'Virgin's Cradle Song,' already mentioned
as one of the compositions of 1865; two sets of four-part
Songs, the one for accompanied Solo voices, the other for
mixed Chorus <i>a capella</i>, and the two books of Songs, Op. 94
and 95.</p>

<p>At this date Brahms had entered into what we may call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the third period of his activity as a song-writer&mdash;one in
which he frequently chose texts that speak of loneliness
or death. The wonderful beauty of his settings of these
subjects penetrates the very soul, and by the mere force of
its pathos carries to the hearer the conviction that the composer
speaks out of the feeling of his own heart. Stockhausen,
trying the song 'Mit vierzig Jahren' (Op. 94, No. 1)
from the manuscript to the composer's accompaniment,
was so affected during its performance that he could not at
once proceed to the end. Our remarks are, however, by
no means intended to convey the impression that Brahms
only or generally chose poems of a melancholy tendency at
this time.</p>

<p class="center">WITH FORTY YEARS.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Friedrich R&uuml;ckert</span> (1788-1866).</p>

<p class="lyrics">
With forty years we've gained the mountain's summit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We stand awhile and look behind;</span><br />
There we behold the quiet years of childhood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there the joy of youth we find.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take up thy staff and onward wend!</span><br />

</p>

<p>With the knowledge we have gained of the master's habit
of producing his large works in couples, we are prepared to
find him employed this summer on the composition of a
fourth symphony. Avoiding a long journey, he settled
down to his work at M&uuml;rz Zuschlag in Styria, not far from
the highest ridge of the Semmering. Hearing soon after
his arrival there that his old friend Misi Reinthaler, now
grown up into a young lady, was leaving home under her
mother's care to go through a course of treatment under a
famous Vienna specialist, he wrote to place his rooms in
Carlsgasse at Frau Reinthaler's disposal. The offer was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
accepted, but when the invalid was sufficiently convalescent,
he insisted that the two ladies should come for a few days
as his guests to M&uuml;rz Zuschlag, where he took rooms for
them near his own lodgings. He went over to see them also
at Vienna, and spent the greater part of a morning showing
them his valuable collection of autographs and other
treasures. 'Yes, these would have been something to give
a wife!' was his answer to the ladies' expressions of delight.
Amongst his collection of musical autographs were two
written on different sides of the same sheet of paper&mdash;one of
Beethoven, the song 'Ich liebe dich'; the other of Schubert,
part of a pianoforte composition. These, with Brahms'
autograph signature 'Joh. Brahms in April 1872,' written
at the bottom of one of the pages, constitute a unique
triplet. The sheet now belongs to the Gesellschaft library,
and is framed within glass.</p>

<p>The society of Hanslick, who came with his wife to stay
near M&uuml;rz Zuschlag for part of the summer, was very
acceptable to Brahms. The departure of his friends at the
close of the season, in the company of some mutual Vienna
acquaintances, incited the composer to an act of courtesy of
a kind quite unusual with him, the sequel to which seems
to have caused him almost comical annoyance that found
expression in a couple of notes sent immediately afterwards
to Hanslick.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dearest Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Here I stand with roses and pansies; which means

<p>and, on finding that, mistaking the time of the train, he had
arrived a quarter of an hour late:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'How such a stupid thing can spoil one's day and the

<p>The journeys of the winter included visits to Bremen and
Oldenburg, during which Hermine Spiess, one of the very
favourite younger interpreters of Brahms' songs, sang
dainty selections of them to the composer's accompaniment,
with overwhelming success. The early death of this gifted
artist, soon after her marriage, caused the master, with
whom she was a great favourite, deep and sincere grief.
Brahms went also to Crefeld, where the 'Tafellied,' dedicated
on publication 'To the friends in Crefeld in remembrance
of Jan. 28th 1885,' was sung on the date in question,
with some of the new part-songs <i>a capella</i>, and other of the
composer's works, at the jubilee of the Crefeld Concert
Society. The manuscript score of the 'Tafellied' is in the
possession of Herr Alwin von Beckerath, to whom it was
presented by Brahms with an affectionate inscription.</p>

<p>The early part of the year 1885 offers for record no event
of unusual interest to the reader. The greater portion of
it was spent by Brahms in his customary routine in Vienna.
He was generally to be seen at the weekly meetings of the
Tonk&uuml;nstlerverein, a musicians' club founded by Epstein,
G&auml;nsbacher, and others, of which the master had consented
to be named honorary life-president. The Monday evening
proceedings included a short musical programme, sometimes
followed by an informal supper. Brahms did not
usually sit in the music-room, but would remain in a smaller
apartment smoking and chatting sociably with friends of
either sex. His arrival always became known at once to
the assembled company, 'Brahms is here; Brahms is
come!' being passed eagerly from mouth to mouth. His
old love of open-air exercise had not diminished with increasing
years, and the Sunday custom of a long walk in
the country was still kept up. A few friends used to meet
in the morning outside the Caf&eacute; Bauer, opposite the Opera
House, and, taking train or tram to the outskirts of the
city, would thence proceed on foot, returning in the late
afternoon. Brahms, nearly always in a good humour on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
these occasions, was generally soon ahead of his companions,
or leading the way with the foremost, and, as had usually
been the case with him through life, was looked upon by
his friends as the chief occasion of their meetings, allowed
his own way, and admired as a kind of pet oracle. The
excursions always commenced for the season on his return
to Vienna in the autumn, and were continued with considerable
regularity until his departure in the spring. They not
infrequently gave opportunity for the employment of the
composer's unfailing readiness of repartee, as on the occasion
of a meeting in the train, on the return journey, with a
learned but unmusical acquaintance of one of the party,
between whom and Brahms an animated conversation arose.
'Will you not join us one day, Herr Doctor? Next Sunday,
perhaps?' asked Brahms. 'I!' exclaimed the other.
'Saul among the prophets?' 'Na, so you give yourself
royal airs!' instantly rejoined the master.</p>

<p>The fourth symphony was completed during the summer
at M&uuml;rz Zuschlag, where Brahms this year had the advantage
of Dr. and Frau Fellinger's society, and&mdash;indispensable for
his complete enjoyment of a home circle&mdash;that of their
children. Returning one afternoon from a walk, he found
that the house in which he lodged had caught fire, and that
his friends were busily engaged in bringing his papers, and
amongst them the nearly-finished manuscript of the new
symphony, into the garden. He immediately set to work
to help in getting the fire under, whilst Frau Fellinger sat
out of doors with either arm outspread on the precious
papers piled on each side of her. Luckily, all serious harm
was averted, and it was soon possible to restore the manuscripts
intact to the composer's apartments.</p>

<p>Brahms paid a neighbourly call, in the course of the
summer, on the author Rosegger, who was living in his
small country house at Krieglach near M&uuml;rz Zuschlag, and
tasted the unusual experience of a repulse. Absorbed in
work at the moment when his servant announced 'a strange
gentleman,' Rosegger, without glancing at the card placed
beside him, desired his visitor to 'sit down for a moment.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Conscious only of the presence of a bearded stranger with a
gray overcoat over his shoulder and a light-coloured umbrella
in his hand, he vouchsafed but scant answer to the
trifling remarks with which his caller tried to pave the
way to cordiality, and before long Brahms composedly
remarked that he would be on his legs again, and took
leave. It was not till some minutes after his departure
that it occurred to Rosegger to glance at the card, and he
has himself described the feelings of despair with which
he read the words 'Johannes Brahms' staring at him in
all the reality of black on white. Not he alone, but the
ladies of his family, were enthusiastic admirers of the composer's
genius. He was so overwhelmed by his mistake
as to be incapable of taking any steps to remedy it, and
firmly declined to yield to the entreaties of his wife and
daughter that he would return the visit and explain
matters to Brahms. He published an amusing account of
the misadventure in the year 1894 in an issue of the
<i>Heimgarten</i>. Perhaps it may have fallen into the master's
hands.</p>

<p>The honour not only of the first, but of several subsequent
early performances of the Symphony in E minor, fell to the
Meiningen orchestra. The work was announced for the
third subscription concert of the season 1885-86, and
shortly beforehand the score and parts of the third and
fourth movements were sent by the composer to Meiningen
for correction at a preliminary rehearsal under B&uuml;low.
Three listeners were, by B&uuml;low's invitation, present on the
occasion&mdash;the Landgraf of Hesse; Richard Strauss, the now
famous composer, who had succeeded Mannst&auml;dt as second
conductor of the Meiningen orchestra; and Frederic Lamond.
The lapse of another day or so brought Brahms himself with
the first and second movements, and the first public performance
of the work took place on October 25.</p>

<p>That the new symphony was enthusiastically received on
the occasion goes almost without saying. Persevering but
unsuccessful efforts were made by the audience to obtain a
repetition of the third movement, and the close of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
was followed by the emphatic demonstration incident to a
great success.</p>

<p>The work was repeated under B&uuml;low's direction at the
following Meiningen concert of November 1, and was conducted
by the composer throughout a three weeks' tour
on which he started with B&uuml;low and his orchestra immediately
afterwards, and which included the towns Siegen,
Dortmund, Essen, Elberfeld, D&uuml;sseldorf, Rotterdam, Utrecht,
Amsterdam, the Hague, Arnheim, Crefeld, Bonn, and
Cologne. A performance at Wiesbaden followed, and the
work was heard for the first time in Vienna at the Philharmonic
concert of January 17, 1886, under Richter.
This occasion was celebrated by a dinner given by Billroth
at the H&ocirc;tel Sacher, the guests invited to meet the composer
being Richter, Hanslick, Goldmark, Faber, Door,
Epstein, Ehrbar, Fuchs, Kalbeck, and D&ouml;mpke.</p>

<p>A new and important work by Brahms could hardly fail
to obtain a warm reception in Vienna at a period when the
composer could look back to thirty years' residence in the
imperial city with which his name had become as closely
associated as those of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and
Schubert; but though the symphony was applauded by
the public and praised by all but the inveterately hostile
section of the press, it did not reach the hearts of the
Vienna audience in the same unmistakable manner as its
two immediate predecessors, both of which had, as we
have seen, made a more striking impression on a first
hearing in Austria than the first Symphony in C minor.
Strangely enough, the fourth symphony at once obtained
some measure of real appreciation in Leipzig, where the
first had been far more successful than the second and
third. It was performed under the composer at the Gewandhaus
concert of February 18. The account given of the
occasion by the <i>Leipziger Nachrichten</i> is, perhaps, the more
satisfactory since our old friend D&ouml;rffel, who might possibly
have been suspected of partiality, had long since retired
from the staff of the journal. Bernhard V&ouml;gl, his second
successor, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'... The reception must, we think, have made amends
to Brahms for former ones, which, in B&uuml;low's opinion, were
too cool. After each movement the hall resounded with
tumultuous and long-continued applause, and, at the conclusion
of the work, the composer was repeatedly called forward....
The finale is certainly the most original of the
movements, and furnishes more complete argument than
has before been brought forward for the opinion of those
who see in Brahms the modern Sebastian Bach. The movement
is not only constructed on the form displayed in Bach's
Chaconne for violin, but is filled with Bach's spirit. It is
built up with astounding mastery upon the eight notes,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<a href="music/fig_p218.mid">[Listen]</a>
</div>

<p>and in such a manner that its contrapuntal learning remains
subordinate to its poetic contents.... It can be compared
with no former work of Brahms and stands alone in
the symphonic literature of the present and the past.'</p>

<p>A still more triumphant issue attended the production of
the symphony under Brahms at a concert of the Hamburg
Cecilia Society on April 9. Josef Sittard, who had recently
been appointed musical critic to the <i>Hamburger Correspondenten</i>,
a post he has held to the present day, wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'To-day we abide by what we have affirmed for years
past in musical journals; that Brahms is the greatest instrumental
composer since Beethoven. Power, passion, depth
of thought, exalted nobility of melody and form, are the
qualities which form the artistic sign manual of his creations.
The E minor (fourth) Symphony is distinguished from the
second and third principally by the rigorous and even grim
earnestness which, though in a totally different way, mark
the first. More than ever does the composer follow out his
ideas to their conclusion, and this unbending logic makes
the immediate understanding of the work difficult. But
the oftener we have heard it, the more clearly have its great
beauties, the depth, energy and power of its thoughts, the
clearness of its classic form, revealed themselves to us. In
the contrapuntal treatment of its themes, in richness of
harmony and in the art of instrumentation, it seems to as
superior to the second and third, these, perhaps, have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>advantage of greater melodic beauty; a guarantee of popularity.
In depth, power and originality of conception,
however, the fourth symphony takes its place by the side
of the first....'</p>

<p>After an interesting discussion of the several movements,
the writer adds: 'In a word, the symphony is of monumental
significance.'</p>

<p>Brahms' fourth symphony, produced when he was over
fifty, is, in the opinion of most musicians, unsurpassed by
any other achievement of his genius. It has during the
past twenty years been growing slowly into general knowledge
and favour, and will, it may be safely predicted, become
still more deeply rooted in its place amongst the composer's
most widely-valued works. The second movement, in the
opinion of the late Philipp Spitta, 'does not find its equal in
the symphonic world'; and the fourth, written in 'Passacaglia'
form, is the most astonishing illustration achieved
even by Brahms himself of the limitless capability of variation
form, in which he is pre-eminent.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>It is with something of a mournful feeling that we find
ourselves at the close of our enumeration of the master's
four greatest instrumental works. Enough, we may hope,
has been said to indicate that any comparison of the symphonies
as inferior or superior is impossible, for the reason
that each, while perfectly fulfilling its own particular destiny,
is quite different from all the others, and such natural
preference as may be felt by this or that listener for either
must be considered as purely personal. The present writer
may, perhaps, be allowed to confess that, with all joy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
dainty second and the magnificent third and fourth&mdash;emphatically
the fourth&mdash;neither appeals to her quite so
strongly as the first. There is here a quality of youth in
the intensity of the soaring imagination that seems to search
the universe, which, presented as it is with the wealth of
resource that was at the command of the mature composer,
could not by its nature be other than unique. The presence
of this very quality may be the reason why the first symphony
suffers even more lamentably than its companions
from the dull, cold, cautious, 'classical' rendering which
Brahms' orchestral works receive at the hands of some
conductors, who seem unable to realize that a composer who
founds his works on certain definite and traditional principles
of structure does not thereby change his nature,
or in any degree renounce the free exercise of his poetic gifts.</p>

<p>Perhaps the present is as good an opportunity as may
occur for passing mention of a newspaper episode of the
eighties, which was much talked of for a few years, but which,
though it may have caused Brahms annoyance, could not
possibly at this period of his career have had any more
serious consequence so far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>Hugo Wolf, in 1884 a young aspirant to fame, seeking
recognition but finding none, poor, gifted, disappointed,
weak in health, highly nervous, without influential friends,
accepted an opportunity of increasing his miserably small
means of subsistence by becoming the musical critic of the
<i>Salon Blatt</i>, a weekly society paper of Vienna, and soon made
for himself an unenviable notoriety by his persistent attacks
upon Brahms' compositions. The affair would not now
demand mention in a biography of our master if it were not
that the posthumous recognition afforded to Wolf's art
gives some interest, though not of an agreeable nature, to
this association of his name with that of Brahms. For the
benefit of those readers who may wish to study the matter
further, it may be added that Wolf's criticisms have been
republished since his death. For ourselves, having done what
was, perhaps, incumbent on us by referring to the matter,
we shall adopt what we believe would have been Brahms'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
desire, by allowing it, so far as these pages are concerned, to
follow others of the kind to oblivion.</p>

<p>The summer of 1886 was the first of the three seasons
passed by Brahms at Thun, of which Widmann has written
so charming an account. He rented the entire first-floor of
a house opposite the spot where the river Aare flows out of
the lake, the ground-floor being occupied by the owner, who
kept a little haberdashery shop. According to his general
custom, he dined in fine weather in the garden of some inn,
occasionally alone, but oftener in the company of a friend or
friends. Every Saturday he went to Bern to remain till
Monday or longer with the Widmanns, who, like other
friends, found him a most considerate and easily satisfied
guest, though his exceptional energy of body and mind
often made it exhausting work to keep up with him.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'His week-end visits were,' says Widmann, 'high festivals
and times of rejoicing for me and mine; days of rest they
certainly were not, for the constantly active mind of our
guest demanded similar wakefulness from all his associates
and one had to pull one's self well together to maintain
sufficient freshness to satisfy the requirements of his indefatigable
vitality.... I have never seen anyone who
took such fresh, genuine and lasting interest in the surroundings
of life as Brahms, whether in objects of nature,
art, or even industry. The smallest invention, the improvement
of some article for household use, every trace, in short,
of practical ingenuity gave him real pleasure. And nothing
escaped his observation.... He hated bicycles because
the flow of his ideas was so often disturbed by the noiseless
rushing past, or the sudden signal, of these machines, and also
because he thought the trampling movement of the rider
ugly. He was, however, glad to live in the age of great
inventions and could not sufficiently admire the electric
light, Edison's phonographs, etc. He was equally interested
in the animal world. I always had to tell him anew about
the family customs of the bears in the Bern bear-pits before
which we often stood together. Indeed, subjects of conversation
seemed inexhaustible during his visits.'<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Brahms' ordinary costume, the same here as elsewhere,
was chosen quite without regard to appearances. Mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
lapse of time must occasionally have compelled him to wear
a new coat, but it is safe to conclude that his feelings suffered
discomposure on the rare occurrence of such a crisis.
Neckties and white collars were reserved as special marks
of deference to conventionality. During his visits to Thun
he used on wet Saturdays to appear at Bern wearing 'an
old brown-gray plaid fastened over his chest with an immense
pin, which completed his strange appearance.' Many were
the books borrowed from Widmann at the beginning, and
brought back at the end, of the week, carried by him in a
leather bag slung over his shoulder. Most of them were
standard works; he was not devoted to modern literature
on the whole, though he read with pleasure new and really
good books of history and travel, and was fond of Gottfried
Keller's novels and poems. Over engravings and photographs
of Italian works of art he would pore for hours, never
weary of discussing memories and predilections with his friend.</p>

<p>Visits to the Bern summer theatre, a short mountain tour
with Widmann, an introduction to Ernst von Wildenbruch,
whose dramas the master liked, and with whom he now found
himself in personal sympathy&mdash;events such as these served
to diversify the summer season of 1886, which was made
musically noteworthy by the composition of a group of
chamber works, the Sonatas in A and F major for pianoforte
with violin and violoncello respectively, and the Trio in C
minor for pianoforte and strings. The Sonatas were performed
for the first time in public in Vienna; severally by
Brahms and Hellmesberger, at the Quartet concert of
December 2, and by Brahms and Hausmann at Hausmann's
concert of November 24; the Trio was introduced at Budapest
about the same time by Brahms, Hubay, and Popper,
in each case from the manuscript.</p>

<p>Detailed discussion of these works is superfluous; two
of them, at all events, are amongst the best known of
Brahms' compositions. The Sonata for pianoforte and
violoncello in F is the least familiar of the group, but
assuredly not because it is inferior to its companions. It is,
indeed, one of the masterpieces of Brahms' later concise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
style. Each movement has a remarkable individuality of
its own, whilst all are unmistakably characteristic of the
composer. The first is broad and energetic, the second
profoundly touching, the third vehemently passionate&mdash;in
the Brahms' signification of the word, be it noted, which
means that the emotions are reached through the intellectual
imagination&mdash;the fourth written from beginning to end in
a spirit of vivacity and fun. The work was tried in the first
instance at Frau Fellinger's house. 'Are you expecting
Hausmann?' Brahms inquired carelessly of this lady soon
after his return in the autumn. Frau Fellinger, suspecting
that something lay behind the question, telegraphed to the
great violoncellist, who usually stayed at her house when in
Vienna, to come as soon as possible, if only for a day. He
duly appeared, and the new sonata was played by Brahms
and himself on the evening of his arrival. They performed
it again the day before the concert above recorded, at a large
party at Billroth's.</p>

<p>The last movement of the beautiful Sonata in A for
pianoforte and violin is sometimes criticised as being
almost too concise. The present writer confesses that she
always feels it to be so, and one day confided this sentiment
to Joachim, who did not agree with her, but said that the
coda was originally considerably longer. 'Brahms told me he
had cut a good deal away; he aimed always at condensation.'</p>

<p>Dr. Widmann allows us to publish an English version of a
poem written by him on this work, the original of which is
published in the appendix to his 'Brahms Recollections.'
We have desired to place it before our English-speaking
readers, not only because it coincides remarkably with what
we related in our early chapters of the delicate, fanciful
tastes of the youthful Hannes, but because it gave pleasure
to the Brahms of fifty-three, and even of sixty-three, and
thus seems to illustrate the fact on which we have insisted,
that if in any case then in our master's, the child was father
to the man. Only a year before his death the great composer
wrote to Widmann to beg for one or two more copies
of the poem, which had been printed for private circulation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<br />By Johannes Brahms</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">WRITTEN BY</span><br />J. V. WIDMANN.</p>

<p class="lyrics">
There where the Aare's waters gently glide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From out the lake and flow towards the town,</span><br />
Where pleasant shelter spreading trees provide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amidst the waving grass I laid me down;</span><br />
And sleeping softly on that summer day,<br />
I saw a wondrous vision as I lay.</p>

<p class="lyrics">Three knights rode up on proudly stepping steeds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tiny as elves, but with the mien of kings,</span><br />
And spake to me: 'We come to search the meads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To seek a treasure here, of precious things</span><br />
Amongst the fairest; wilt thou help us trace<br />
A new-born child, a child of heav'nly race?'</p>

<p class="lyrics">'And who are ye?' I, dreaming, made reply;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Knights of the golden meadows' then they said,</span><br />
'That at the foot of yonder Niesen<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> lie;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in our ancient castles many a maid</span><br />
Hath listened to the greeting of our strings,<br />
Long mute and passed amid forgotten things.</p>

<p class="lyrics">'But lately tones were heard upon the lake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sound of strings whose like we never knew,</span><br />
So David played, perhaps, for Saul's dread sake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soothing the monarch curtained from his view;</span><br />
It reached us as it softly swelled and sank,<br />
And drew us, filled with longing, to this bank.</p>

<p class="lyrics">'Then help us search, for surely from this place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This meadow by the river, came the sound;</span><br />
Help us then here the miracle to trace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That we may offer homage when 'tis found.</span><br />
Sleeps under flow'rs the new-born creature rare?<br />
Or is it floating in the evening air?'</p>

<p class="lyrics">But ere they ceased, a sudden rapid twirl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ruffled the waters, and, before our eyes,</span><br />
A fairy boat from out the wavelet's whirl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Floated up stream, guided by dragon-flies;</span><br />
Within it sat a sweet-limbed, fair-haired may,<br />
Singing as to herself in ecstasy.</p>
<p class="lyrics"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
'To ride on waters clear and cool is sweet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For clear as deep my being's living source;</span><br />
To open worlds where joy and sorrow meet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each flowing pure and full in mingling course;</span><br />
Go on, my boat, upstream with happy cheer,<br />
Heaven is reposing on the tranquil mere.'</p>

<p class="lyrics">So sang the fairy child and they that heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Owned, by their swelling hearts, the music's might,</span><br />
The knights had only tears, nor spake a word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Welling from pain that thrilled them with delight;</span><br />
But when the skiff had vanished from their eyes,<br />
The eldest, pointing, said in tender wise:</p>

<p class="lyrics">'Thou beauteous wonder of the boat, farewell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet melody, revealed to us to-day;</span><br />
We that with slumb'ring minnesingers dwell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bid thee Godspeed, thou guileless stranger fay;</span><br />
Our land is newly consecrate in thee<br />
That rang of old with fame of minstrelsy.</p>

<p class="lyrics">'Now we may sleep again amongst our dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The harper's holy spirit is awake,</span><br />
And as the evening glory, purple-red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shineth upon our Alps and o'er our lake,</span><br />
And yet on distant mountain sheds its light,<br />
Throughout the earth this song will wing its flight.</p>

<p class="lyrics">'Yet, though subduing many a list'ning throng,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In stately town, in princely hall it sound,</span><br />
To this our land it ever will belong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For here on flowing river it was found.'</span><br />
Fervent and glad the minnesinger spake;<br />
'Yes!' cried my heart&mdash;and then I was awake.
</p>

<p>Whilst our master had been living through the spring and
summer months in the enchanted world of his imagination,
coming out of it only for brief intervals of sojourn in earth's
pleasant places amidst the companionship of chosen friends,
certain hard, commonplace realities of the workaday world,
which had arisen earlier at home in Vienna, were still awaiting
a satisfactory solution. The death of the occupier of the
third-floor flat of No. 4, Carlsgasse, the last remaining
member of the family with whom Brahms had lodged for
fourteen or fifteen years, had confronted him with the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
of choosing between several alternatives almost equally
disagreeable to him, concerning which it is only necessary to
say that he had avoided the annoyance of a removal by
taking on the entire dwelling direct from the landlord, and
had escaped the disturbance of having to replace the furniture
of his rooms by accepting the offer of friends to lend
him sufficient for his absolute needs. Arrangements and all
necessary changes were made during his absence. To Frau
Fellinger Brahms had entrusted the keys of the flat and of
his rooms, which under her directions were brought into
apple-pie order by the time of his return, the drawers being
tidied, and a list of the contents of each neatly drawn up
on a piece of cardboard, so that everything should be ready
to his hand. The greatest difficulty, however, still remained.
Who was to keep the rooms in order and see to the very few
of Brahms' daily requirements which he was not in the habit
of looking after himself? His coffee, as we know, he always
prepared at a very early hour in the morning, and he was
kept provided with a regular supply of the finest Mocha by
a lady friend at Marseilles. Dinner, afternoon coffee, and
often supper, were taken away from home. The master now
declared he would have no one in the flat. To as many
visitors as he felt disposed to admit he could himself open
the door, whilst the cleaning and tidying of the rooms could
be done by the 'Hausmeisterin,' an old woman occupying a
room in the courtyard, and responsible for the cleaning of
the general staircase, etc. In vain Frau Fellinger contested
the point. Brahms was inflexible, and this kind lady
apparently withdrew her opposition to his plan, though
remaining quietly on the look-out for an opportunity of
securing more suitable arrangements. By-and-by it presented
itself. In Frau Celestine Truxa, the widow of a
journalist, whose family party consisted of two young sons and
an old aunt, Frau Fellinger felt that she saw a most desirable
tenant for the Carlsgasse flat, and after a renewed attack
on the master, whose arguments, founded on the immaculate
purity of his rooms under the old woman's care, she irretrievably
damaged by lifting a sofa cushion and laying bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
a collection of dust, which she declared would soon develop
into something worse, he was so far shaken as to say that if
she would make inquiries for him he would consider her
views. Frau Fellinger wisely abstained from further discussion,
but after a few days Frau Truxa herself, having
been duly advised to open the matter to Brahms with diplomatic
sang-froid, went in person to apply for the dwelling.
After her third ring at the door-bell, the door was opened by
the master himself, who started in dismay at seeing a strange
lady standing in front of him.</p>

<p>'I have come to see the flat,' said Frau Truxa.</p>

<p>'What!' cried Brahms.</p>

<p>'I have heard there is an empty flat here, and have come
to look at it,' responded Frau Truxa indifferently; 'but
perhaps it is not to let?'</p>

<p>A moment's pause, and the composer's suspicious expression
relaxed.</p>

<p>'Frau Dr. Fellinger mentioned the circumstances to me,'
she continued, 'and I thought they might suit me.'</p>

<p>By this time Brahms had become sufficiently reassured to
show the rooms and to listen, though without remark, to a
brief description of Frau Truxa's family and of the circumstances
in which she found herself.</p>

<p>'Perhaps, Dr. Brahms, you will consider the matter,' she
concluded, 'and communicate with me if you think further
of it. If I hear nothing more from you, I shall consider the
matter at an end.'</p>

<p>After about a week, during which Frau Truxa kept her
own confidence, her maid came one day to tell her a gentleman
had called to see her. Being engaged at the moment, she
asked her aunt to ascertain his business, but the old lady
returned immediately with a frightened look.</p>

<p>'I don't know what to think!' she exclaimed; 'there is
a strange-looking man walking about in the next room
measuring the furniture with a tape!'</p>

<p>'The things will all go in!' exclaimed the master as Frau
Truxa hurried to receive him.</p>

<p>The upshot was that the master gave up the tenancy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the flat, returning to his old irresponsible position as lodger,
whilst Frau Truxa, bringing her household with her, stepped
into the position of his former landlady, thereby giving
Brahms cause to be grateful for the remainder of his life
for Frau Fellinger's wise firmness. He was, says Frau
Truxa, perfectly easy to get on with; all he desired was to
be let alone. He was extremely orderly and neat in his ways,
and expected the things scattered about his room to be dusted
and kept tidy, but was vexed if he found the least trifle at
all displaced&mdash;even if his glasses were turned the wrong way&mdash;and,
without making direct allusion to the subject, would
manage to show that he had noticed it. Observing, after
she had been a little time in the flat, that he always rearranged
the things returned from the laundress after they
had been placed in their drawer, she asked him why he did
so. 'Only,' he said, 'because perhaps it is better that those
last sent back should be put at the bottom, then they all
get worn alike.' A glove or other article requiring a little
mending would be placed carelessly at the top of a drawer
left open as if by accident. The next day he would observe
to Frau Truxa, 'I found my glove mended last night; I
wonder who can have done it!' and on her replying, 'I
did it, Herr Doctor,' would answer, 'You? How very
kind!'</p>

<p>Frau Truxa came to respect and honour the composer
more and more the longer he lived in her house. She made
his peculiarities her study, and after a short time understood
his little signs, and was able to supply his requirements as
they arose without being expressly asked to do so. It is
almost needless to say that he took great interest in her two
boys, and once, when she was summoned away from Vienna
to the sick-bed of her father, begged that the maid-servant
might be instructed to give all her attention to the children
during their mother's absence, even if his rooms were neglected.
'I can take care of myself, but suppose something
were to happen to the children whilst the girl was engaged
for me!' Every night whilst Frau Truxa was away, the
master himself looked in on the boys to assure himself of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
their being safe in bed. For the old aunt he always had a
pleasant passing word.</p>

<p>The fourth Symphony and two books of Songs were published
in 1886, and the three new works of chamber music,
Op. 99, 100, 101, in 1887. Of the songs we would select
for particular mention the wonderfully beautiful setting of
Heine's verses:</p>

<p class="lyrics">
'Death is the cool night,<br />
Life is the sultry day,'
</p>

<p>Op. 96, No. 1, and Nos. 1 and 2 of Op. 97.</p>

<p>Brahms' Italian journey in the spring of 1887 was made
in the company of Simrock and Kirchner. The following
year he travelled in Widmann's society, visiting Verona,
Bologna, Rimini, Ancona, Loretto, Rome, and Turin.
Widmann sees in Brahms' spiritual kinship with the masters
of the Italian Renaissance the chief secret of his love for
Italy.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Their buildings, their statues, their pictures were his
delight and when one witnessed the absorbed devotion with
which he contemplated their works, or heard him admire in
the old masters a trait conspicuous in himself, their conscientious
perfection of detail ... even where it could
hardly be noticeable to the ordinary observer, one could
not help instituting the comparison between himself and
them.'</p>

<p>Brahms had an interview when on this journey with the
now famous Italian composer Martucci, who displayed a
thorough familiarity with the works of the German master.</p>

<p>Amongst the friends and acquaintances whom the composer
met at Thun during his second and third summers
there were the Landgraf of Hesse, Hanslick, Gottfried
Keller, Professor B&auml;chthold, Hermine Spiess and her sister,
Gustav Wendt, the Hegars, Max Kalbeck, Steiner, Claus
Groth, etc. One day, as he had started for a walk, he was
stopped by a stranger, who asked if he knew where Dr.
Brahms lived. 'He lives there,' replied the master, pointing
to the haberdasher's shop. 'Do you know if he is at home?'
'That I cannot tell you,' was the reply. 'But go and ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
in the shop; you will certainly be able to find out there.'
The gentleman followed this advice, sent his card up, and
received the answer that the Doctor was at home, and
would be pleased to see him. To his surprise, on ascending
the stairs, he found his newly-formed acquaintance waiting
for him at the top.</p>

<span class="caption">Brahms&#39; Lodgings near Thun.<br />

</div>

<p>The rumour revived in the summer of 1887 that Brahms
was engaged on an opera. This came about, perhaps,
from his intimacy with Widmann. 'I am composing the
entr'actes,' he jestingly replied to the Landgraf's question
as to whether the report had any foundation. As a matter
of fact, the subject of opera was not mentioned between the
composer and his friend at this time.</p>

<p>The works which really occupied Brahms during the
summer of 1887 were the double Concerto for violin and
violoncello, with orchestral accompaniment, and the 'Gipsy
Songs.'</p>

<p>The Concerto was performed privately, immediately on
its completion, in the 'Louis Quinze' room of the Baden-Baden
Kurhaus. Brahms conducted, and the solo parts
were performed by Joachim and Hausmann. Amongst the
listeners were Frau Schumann and her eldest daughter,
Rosenhain, Lachner, the violoncellist Hugo Becker, and
Gustav Wendt. The work was heard in public for the
first time in Cologne on October 15, Brahms conducting,
and Joachim and Hausmann playing the solos as before;
and the next performances, carried out under the same
unique opportunities for success, were in Wiesbaden, Frankfurt,
and Basle, on November 17, 18, and 20.</p>

<p>In the autumn of this year one of the few remaining
figures linked with the most cherished associations of
Brahms' early youth passed away. Marxsen died on
November 17, 1887, at the age of eighty-one, having retained
to the end almost unimpaired vigour of his mental
faculties. The last great pleasure of his life was associated
with his beloved art. In spite of great bodily weakness, he
managed to be present a week before his death at a concert
of the Hamburg Philharmonic Society to hear a performance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>of the 'ninth' Symphony. 'I am here for the last
time,' he said, pressing Sittard's hand; and he passed
peacefully away fourteen days later.</p>

<p>A few years previously his artistic jubilee had been celebrated
in Hamburg, and his dear Johannes had surprised
him with the proof-sheets of a set of one hundred Variations
composed long ago by Marxsen, not with a view to publication,
but as a practical illustration of the inexhaustible possibilities
contained in the art of thematic development.
Brahms, who happened to see the manuscript in Marxsen's
room during one of his subsequent visits to Hamburg, was
so strongly interested in it that in the end Marxsen gave it
him, with leave to do as he should like with it after his death.
The parcel of proof-sheets was accompanied by an affectionate
letter, in which Brahms begged forgiveness for
having anticipated this permission and yielded to his desire
of placing the work within general reach during his master's
lifetime; and perhaps no jubilee honour of which the old
musician was the recipient filled him with such lively joy
as was caused by this tribute. Marxsen's name as a composer
is, indeed, now forgotten without chance of revival,
but his memory will live gloriously in the way he would
have chosen, carried through the years by the hand that
wrote the great composer's acknowledgment to his teacher
on the title-page of the Concerto in B flat.</p>

<p>Four more performances from the manuscript of the
double concerto of interest in our narrative remain to be
chronicled&mdash;those of the Leipzig Gewandhaus, under Brahms,
on January 1, 1888; of the Berlin Philharmonic Society,
under B&uuml;low, of February 6; and of the London Symphony
Concerts, under Henschel, on February 15 and 21. The
work, published in time for the autumn season, was given
in Vienna at the Philharmonic concert of December 23 under
Richter. On all these occasions the solos were played, as
before, by Joachim and Hausmann.</p>

<p>B&uuml;low, having at this time resigned his post at Meiningen,
had entered on a period of activity as conductor in some of
the northern cities of Germany, and particularly in Hamburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and Berlin. His future programmes, in which our
master's works were well represented, though not with the
conspicuous prominence that had been possible at Meiningen,
do not fall within the scope of these pages, since, with the
mention of the double concerto, the enumeration of Brahms'
orchestral works is complete. B&uuml;low's successor at Meiningen,
Court Capellmeister Fritz Steinbach, carried on the
traditions and preferences of the little Thuringian capital
as he found them, until his removal to Cologne a year or
two ago, and has become especially appreciated as a conductor
of the works of Brahms, whose personal friendship
and artistic confidence he enjoyed in a high degree.</p>

<p>The name of Eugen d'Albert, whose great gifts and attainments
were warmly recognised by Brahms, should not be
omitted from our pages, though detailed account of his
relations with the master is outside their limits. D'Albert's
fine performances of the pianoforte concertos helped to
make these works familiar to many Continental audiences,
and certainly contributed, during the second half of the
eighties, to the better understanding of the great composer
which has gradually come to prevail at Leipzig.</p>

<p>But little needs to be said about the double concerto.
This fine work, which may be regarded as in some sort a
successor to the double and triple concertos of Mozart and
Beethoven, exhibits all the power of construction, the command
of resource, the logical unity of idea, characteristic
of Brahms' style, whilst its popularity has been hindered
by the same cause that has retarded that of the pianoforte
concertos; the solo parts do not stand out sufficiently from
the orchestral accompaniment to give effective opportunity
for the display of virtuosity, in the absence of which no
performer, appearing before a great public as the exponent of
an unfamiliar work for an accompanied solo instrument, has
much chance of sustaining the lively interest of his audience
in the composition. Of the three movements of the double
concerto, the first is especially interesting to musicians,
whilst the second, a beautiful example of Brahms' expressive
lyrical muse, appeals equally to less technically prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
listeners. On the copy of the work presented by Brahms to
Joachim the words are inscribed in the composer's handwriting:
'To him for whom it was written.'</p>

<p>Widely contrasted in every respect was the other new
work of 1887, introduced to the private circle of Vienna
musicians at the last meeting for the season of the Tonk&uuml;nstlerverein
in April, 1888. The eleven four-part 'Gipsy
Songs,' published in the course of the year as Op. 103, were
sung from the manuscript by Fr&auml;ulein Walter, Frau Gomperz-Bettelheim,
Gustav Walter, and Weiglein of the
imperial opera, to the composer's accompaniment. Brahms
obtained the texts of this characteristic and attractive work
from a collection of twenty-five 'Hungarian Folk-songs'
translated into German by Hugo Conrat, and published in
Budapest, with their original melodies set by Zoltan Nagy
for mezzo-soprano or baritone, with the addition of pianoforte
accompaniment. Conrat's translations have been
done in masterly fashion. Literal as far as possible, slight
modifications of the original have been admitted here and
there in order to obtain a natural flow of the lines; and to
some single-strophe songs, including Nos. 3 and 4 of Brahms'
work, a second verse, developing the idea of the first, has
been added. The German texts, in which the national
Hungarian character is admirably preserved, appealed irresistibly
to our master, and are well adapted to the four-part
setting with pianoforte accompaniment which had proved
so successful in the two books of Liebeslieder Walzer.</p>

<p>One of the earliest public performances of the Gipsy Songs
was that of the Monday Popular concert of November 26
by Mr. and Mrs. Henschel, Miss Lena Little, and Mr. Shakespeare,
with Miss Fanny Davies as pianist. They were
repeated at the Saturday Popular of December 1, and again
on Monday and Saturday, December 22 and 28. The first
public performance in Vienna&mdash;by the executants who had
already given the work privately&mdash;took place at Walter's
concert in the B&ouml;rsendorfer Hall on January 18, 1889.</p>

<p>The Gipsy Songs had an immediate widespread, and
enormous success, and were soon heard in all parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
musical world. They were sung in Paris in a French translation,
and many times in Budapest, where the composer's
art had become popular, in Hungarian retranslated from
Conrat's version. Great though their popularity has remained,
however, it has not equalled that of the Liebeslieder,
and of these the demand for the first book has continued
to exceed that for the second.</p>

<p>A graphic picture of Brahms as he was in the year 1888
and onwards is to be found in an article by Dr. Jenner.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
This gentleman made the master's acquaintance under particularly
interesting circumstances. When still a very
young man, resident at Kiel, and a favourite of Claus Groth,
the manuscripts of some of his songs came under Brahms'
notice, and so much engaged his sympathy as to induce him
to say he would be happy to receive the composer during
his visit to Leipzig on the occasion of the above-recorded
performance of the new double concerto.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'My friend Julius Spengel joined me in Hamburg and
we went together to Berlin,' says Dr. Jenner. 'There I
was present for the first time at a Joachim Quartet evening.
Immediately after the concert we travelled with the Quartet
to Leipzig, arriving in the middle of the night at the H&ocirc;tel
Hauffe. Never shall I forget the feeling that came over
me as I read in the visitors' list, "Johannes Brahms from
Vienna." He had already retired. By a strange chance I
was shown into the room next his and as I entered it a sound
of healthy snoring proclaimed the proximity of the mighty
one. Moving about quietly, I went to rest with a strange
mixed feeling of awe, pride and anxiety. When I came
down the next morning Brahms had already breakfasted.
Comfortably smoking, he was reading the papers.... He
received me with pleasant, simple kindness, intimated that
he knew why I had come, and took pains to help me over my
first embarrassment and shyness by every now and then
putting to me some short, direct question, so that I was soon
convinced of his good-nature and felt unlimited confidence
in him....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It was past 3 o'clock when we returned that night to the
H&ocirc;tel Hauffe. How delighted but also astonished I was when
Brahms, as he said good-night, announced that he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>expect me in his room at 7 o'clock in the morning to speak
to me about my compositions. I presented myself punctually
at the appointed time and found him at breakfast,
fresh, rosy and the picture of equanimity....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I had brought a trio for pianoforte and strings, a chorus
with orchestral accompaniment, unaccompanied choruses
for women's voices, and songs; and found that he had made
himself acquainted with them down to the smallest detail,
and, indeed, later he never looked through work with me
which he had not thoroughly examined beforehand. After
a few introductory remarks, in which he said that he had
formed a generally favourable impression of my compositions,
he gave me back the accompanied chorus with the
words "Pity for the beautiful little poem." It was Claus
Groth's "Wenn ein m&uuml;der Leib." The <i>a capella</i> choruses
met with the same fate; I received them back with the
remark "Such things are very difficult to make...."'</p>

<p>For the sequel the reader must be referred to the article
itself, which amusingly describes the tranquil and ruthless
methods by which the master reduced his young friend to the
verge of despair. All ended well, however, and the middle
of February saw the arrival in Vienna of Herr Jenner and
his introduction to Mandyczewski, under whom he was to go
through a course of study in strict counterpoint, whilst his
work in free composition was to be carried on under the
master's personal supervision. After making Mandyczewski's
acquaintance,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I dined with Brahms at the "Zum Rothen Igel" and afterwards
he went with me to find a lodging, giving preference
to the old houses. Whilst we were on this expedition, he
took every opportunity of making me acquainted with the
sacred places of the city. Before one house it was "This
is the Auge Gottes," before another "Look, Figaro was
written there." At length a suitable room was found near
his own dwelling. "The young man likes music" said
Brahms to the landlady, "will he be able to hear a little
pianoforte playing or singing here sometimes?" This she
could not offer. "Never mind, it does not matter." Then
he gave me one of his coffee-machines, plates, cups, forks,
knives and spoons, so that I was comfortably settled the
first day. The use of his library was at my disposal;
his purse also. I could have as much money as I needed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>from him, but I was never obliged to take any and never
did so....</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I think with deep melancholy of the glorious evenings
when Rottenberg and I sat alone with him in the low back
room of the Igel and the silent Brahms thawed and showed
us glimpses of a great and strong soul. But he never spoke
on such occasions of his works, very rarely of himself and his
life. I have, indeed, often had the good fortune of hearing him
speak of himself whilst he was giving me a lesson; it was
nearly always with some excitement. I was unfortunately
obliged to give up the pleasure of dining with him every
day during my second winter, as the Igel was too dear for
me. Brahms always declared it was the cheapest house in
Vienna and in fact he understood so well how to choose
that he always had to pay less than I and yet got a better
dinner. He was quite extraordinarily moderate in his daily
life; 70-80 kreuzers was the most that he spent for his
dinner and this included a glass of Pilsener beer or a quarter
of a litre of wine. In the evening he drank but little more.
It is only because the contrary has been so often affirmed
that I think it my duty to tell the truth in such detail.'</p>

<p>The old-fashioned restaurant Zum Rothen Igel, where
Brahms was for many years a 'Stammgast'&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a daily
customer&mdash;is situated in a corner of the Wildpret Markt
close to the Augustinestrasse. Brahms did not frequent
the regular dining-room of the house, but took his dinner in
a low, dark, vaulted chamber at the back, on the ground-floor,
ordinarily used by waiters, coachmen, and similar
guests. Here, at a table near a door leading to a small,
gloomy courtyard, many a distinguished guest, the Landgraf
of Hesse, Joachim, and many another, has partaken in
our master's company of the homely but well-cooked dishes
that he preferred. In fact, but few prominent musical
visitors to Vienna quitted the imperial city without making
the acquaintance, under Brahms' auspices, of the dingy
apartment in the Wildpret Markt now called 'the Brahms
room' and decorated with a photograph of the master. He
was very often joined at his mid-day meal by resident friends
and acquaintances, and often supped at the Igel after a
concert with a party of musicians. Amongst those most
frequently seen with him were his old friends Epstein and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Door and a circle of the young men in whom he took an
interest; at the date now reached by our narrative, Mandyczewski
and Rottenberg were his almost daily companions.
If he supped alone at the Igel, he preferred to take his place
in a corner behind the house-door, which was screened
from the taproom by a red curtain and was just large
enough to hold a table and bench, occupied in slack hours by
the manager. During the short time that the weather permitted,
he dined, after his return to Vienna at the beginning of
October, in the 'garden'&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, at one of the two or three tables
placed outside the house, and flanked by large pots of ever-greens
which were carried away when the days became cold.</p>

<p>During the last ten years of his life Brahms allowed himself
to accept more invitations than formerly to dine or sup with
one and another of the small group of families forming his
immediate circle, and when invited out he liked, and even
expected, to be asked to a good table and to have good wine
put before him. He retained the notion, universal in a
former generation, but now out of date, that it was incumbent
on a bidden guest, not only to appreciate, but to show
appreciation, of the hospitality of his host and hostess.
'There are people,' he used to say, 'who are afraid of showing
that they like a good dinner.' Brahms was certainly not
one of these. He was prepared to do ample justice to the
recherch&eacute; cookery and excellent wines with which his friends
liked to regale him, but he was at no period of his life either
a glutton or a wine-bibber, and, indeed, never varied from the
abstemious habits which the early circumstances of his life
had made incumbent on him as a young man.</p>

<p>One of the annual Brahms festivities was the asparagus
luncheon always given by Ehrbar on, or as near as possible
to, May 7, in honour of the master's birthday. About twelve
or sixteen people were invited, amongst whom the Hanslicks
and Billroth and his daughter were regularly included. The
luncheon hour was twelve o'clock, and the menu, which
never varied, consisted of oysters, caviare, cold meat, then
the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>, asparagus, which was always provided
in the proportion of two bundles to each person. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
followed by cheese and dessert, and there was a free flow of
fine champagne.</p>

<p>The summer of 1888, the last one passed by Brahms at
Thun, did not reach the end of its course in such unbroken
tranquillity as the two previous ones. A heated political
discussion with Widmann, in which neither disputant would
give way, threatened to put a sudden end to the intimacy
which had been a source of pleasure and advantage to both
friends. Fortunately this catastrophe was averted by the
good sense of the two men and the cordial affection existing
between them, and when Brahms left Switzerland in October
they looked forward to renewing the experience of a journey
to Italy together which had brought them a succession of
delights in the spring of the year.</p>

<p>The third Sonata for pianoforte and violin, in D minor,
was composed during the summer, and was played for the
first time in public from the manuscript by Brahms and
Joachim at Joachim's Vienna concert of February 13, 1889.
It was published in the spring, with Brahms' dedication to
'his friend Hans von B&uuml;low,' and was performed immediately
afterwards in London by Miss Fanny Davies and Ludwig
Straus at Miss Davies' concert of May 7. The three sonatas
for pianoforte and violin were played one summer's day at
Gm&uuml;nden, by Brahms and Joachim, before the Queen and
royal family of Hanover, an incident which carries the
memory back to the year 1853, when Johannes, having
come safely through the first stages of his concert-journey and
taken Joachim's heart by storm, appeared with Rem&eacute;nyi for
the first time before King George and his circle at Hanover.</p>

<p>The other publications of 1889 were a book of five Songs
for mixed Chorus <i>a capella</i>, and three books of five Songs
each, for a single voice with pianoforte accompaniment. Of
these 'Wie Melodien,' 'Auf dem Kirchhofe,' and 'Verrath'
(Nos. 1, 4, 5 of Op. 105), and 'Serenade' (No. 1 of Op. 106),
are great favourites of the author's. Brahms' songs, however,
offer such rich choice of beauty that the selection of one
or another, even of the more celebrated, for particular
mention must be regarded as little more than the indication
of a personal preference.</p>

<p>From the year 1889 onward Brahms chose for his summer
dwelling-place the charming town of Ischl, the central point
of the beautiful region of the Salzkammergut, and a favourite
watering-place of the Viennese. He rented rooms, as on one
or two former visits, in a cottage prettily situated on the
outskirts of the town near the rushing river Traun, away
from the visitors' quarter and convenient for his favourite
walks about the picturesque mountains which surround the
valley. A strong note of affectionate regret, very characteristic
of the composer, is observable in the letter in which he
announced to Widmann his arrangements for the open-air
season of 1889. His extreme attachment, however, to his
Vienna friends, to whom he may be said to have belonged
almost entirely during the closing years of his life, probably
determined his choice of Ischl, which was well within the
reach of any of them who wished to visit him, whilst several
had villas for summer residence in the immediate neighbourhood.
Johann Strauss always lived at Ischl during the
summer, the Billroths' delightfully situated home at St.
Gilgen could be reached by train or the lake boat service in
an hour, whilst the house and grounds of Herr and Frau
Victor von Miller zu Aichholz at Gm&uuml;nden, and Goldmark's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
rooms, also at Gm&uuml;nden, were not much further off, and so
on with other friends.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I have heard by chance,' writes Billroth from St. Gilgen
to Brahms at Ischl on June 16, 'that Mandyczewski and
Rottenberg are with you ... make up your mind quickly
therefore and come over with them to St. Gilgen and invite
Br&uuml;ll or Goldmark also in my name....'</p>

<p>Brahms always dined when at Ischl in the 'Keller' of the
H&ocirc;tel Elisabeth, which was reached by a flight of steps
leading downwards from the street, and is thus described by
Billroth:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I passed a couple of pleasant hours with Brahms at Ischl.
We dined in a damp, underground room belonging to the
H&ocirc;tel Elisabeth. The same dishes are served there as in the
better class dining-room but at rather cheaper prices; it
is very cool in the summer and no toilet is required; everything
as if made for Brahms.'</p>

<p>The city of Hamburg this year conferred its honorary
citizenship on Brahms, a distinction he shared with Bismarck
and Moltke. Greatly touched by this recognition, the
master let himself go for once, and immediately telegraphed
his thanks to the mayor in natural, impulsive fashion that
he seems to have regretted when he saw his words in print.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... You will find me here,' he wrote to Hanslick from
Ischl, 'until&mdash;I must go to the music festival at Hamburg!
I must, for my honorary citizenship, with all that is associated
with it, has been too pleasant and gratifying. I dread
it, however, for I see that my telegram to the mayor has been
printed! It sounds too foolish; "the best that could have
come to me from men"&mdash;as though I had been thinking of
eternal bliss; whereas all that I had in my mind was that
when a melody occurs to me it is more welcome than an
order, and that if it lead to my succeeding with a symphony,
it gives me more pleasure than all honorary citizenships!...'<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>In acknowledgment of the honour bestowed on him,
Brahms composed three eight-part choruses <i>a capella</i>, which
he entitled 'Fest and Gedenkspr&uuml;che' (Festival and Commemoration
Sayings) and dedicated to the mayor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Hamburg, Herr Oberb&uuml;rgermeister Dr. Petersen. Patriotic
remembrances and hopes were vividly present to his mind as
he composed them, and the work is to be accepted as a
second great musical memorial and glorification of the events
of 1870-71. The texts are again selected from the Bible:
from Deuteronomy, the Psalms, and the Gospels of St.
Matthew and St. Luke. The choruses were studied by the
Cecilia Society, and performed under Spengel at the first of
three festival concerts arranged by B&uuml;low for the opening
of the Hamburg Industrial Exhibition. Sittard calls them
'a splendid musical gift,' and places them amongst the best
and finest of the composer's works.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The "Sayings" do not address themselves to a particular
nation or creed, but speak to every thoughtful mind,
to every human heart susceptible to earnest, ideal influences,
and striving after the high and the beautiful. There lives
in these movements something of that strong confidence
which we find&mdash;expressive of another period of thought and
of art&mdash;in Handel's works, and which acts like a tonic on
every faithful mind. Brahms is the only composer of the
present day who can sufficiently control his own individuality
to be capable of expressing his texts in a musical language
universally applicable and intelligible.'</p>

<p>The work was received with immense enthusiasm, and the
master was obliged to come forward to acknowledge the
long-continued plaudits which followed its conclusion. It
was the last time that he stood on a concert platform of his
native city.</p>

<p>Spengel, who witnessed with B&uuml;low the presentation of
the citizens' document, which took place at Dr. Petersen's
house, relates that Brahms gave warm verbal expression to
the deep feeling animating the written acknowledgment by
which he had supplemented his telegram of thanks. This
letter ran as follows:<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Your Magnificence</span><br />
'<span class="smcap">Most Honourable Herr B&uuml;rgermeister</span>
</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I feel with my whole heart the need to add a few
words to my hasty, short telegram. Kindly permit me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>again to assure your magnificence that my fellow-citizens
have delighted and honoured me beyond measure by the
bestowal of the honorary citizenship. As the artist is
rejoiced by such a distinguished token of recognition, so
also is the man by the glorious feeling of knowing himself so
highly esteemed and loved in his native city. A feeling
doubly proud when this native city is our beautiful, ancient,
noble Hamburg!... The precious gift of my citizen's
letter ... becomes more precious and dear to me as I place
it by the side of my father's citizen's document (still in Low-German).
My father was, indeed, my first thought in
connection with the pleasant event, and one wish only
remains, that he were here to rejoice with me....'</p>

<p>This was not the only mark of the esteem felt for him in
high places by which the master was this year honoured.
The news that the Emperor Francis Joseph had conferred
upon him the distinguished 'Leopold's' order reached him
in Ischl, taking him completely by surprise, and was followed
by an inundation of letters, cards, and telegrams of congratulation,
to all of which he replied individually.</p>

<p>'I was so pleased that the Austrians, as such, were glad
that I was obliged to reply prettily,' he wrote to Hanslick.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Another of the distinctions bestowed upon Brahms late
in his career, which gave him, as a German musician, extraordinary
pleasure, was that of his election as foreign member
of the Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise. He endeavoured to write his
letter of acknowledgment in French, but, not being able to
satisfy himself, was obliged to be content with expressing his
gratification in his own language.</p>

<p>It seems appropriate to record, with the mention of these
pleasant incidents, the fact of Brahms' warm admiration of
the opera 'Carmen,' the work of the French composer Bizet.</p>

<p>A visit to Cologne&mdash;the last&mdash;in February is noteworthy
as having furnished opportunity for the first (private)
performance from the manuscript of three Motets for four
and eight part chorus <i>a capella</i>. They were sung by the
students' choral class of the conservatoire, and on the same
occasion Brahms played&mdash;also from the manuscript&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
two of the professors, the revised edition of his early B major
Trio for the first time outside Vienna. We have already, in
the early pages of our narrative, expressed our preference for
the original version of this lovely work.</p>

<p>A visit to Italy in the spring with Widmann, which included
Parma, Cremona, Brescia, and Vicenza, afforded
Brahms opportunity of deriving pleasure from the most
varied sources. The sight of the cathedral of Cremona by
moonlight, upon which he and Widmann came suddenly the
night of their arrival, as they turned a street corner, quite
overpowered him. He could not gaze long enough at the
wonderful scene, and was obliged to return with his friend to
look at it once again before he could persuade himself to go
in for the night. He was able, on the other hand, to derive
amusement from the trifling incidents of each day's adventures,
and was always ready to meet the passing difficulties
and embarrassments of the traveller with laudable
equanimity and resource. He used, later on, to describe,
with some zest, an opera performance which he attended at
Brescia. The work, he declared, consisted entirely of final
cadences, but was so beautifully sung that he had great
pleasure in listening to it.</p>

<p>His appearance and manner, which at this period of his
life made an irresistible impression of nobility and, generally,
of benevolence on strangers, in spite of his short stature and
careless dress, attracted the constant admiration of his
casual fellow-travellers and of the people of the country
with whom he had to do; and amongst other anecdotes
related by Widmann is one of a guide at Palermo who had
fought under Garibaldi:</p>

<p>'Our refined and amiable guide suddenly stopped short
in the midst of his flowing discourse, and, with a look at
Brahms, exclaimed involuntarily: "Ah! mi pare di parlare
al mio venerabile generale Garibaldi!" at which the master's
eyes lightened enthusiastically.'</p>

<p>Brahms was frequently asked to officiate as godfather to
his friends' children, and this summer he acceded to the
request of Frau Dr. Marie Janssen, eldest daughter of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
first teacher, Cossel, that he would stand sponsor to her little
son. A few months later Frau Janssen sent him a photograph
of two of her children, which he acknowledged in the
following words:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear and esteemed lady</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I am not able to write a real letter however strongly
your kind and welcome packet tempts me to do so. Let me,
however, briefly express my thanks and believe that my
most cordial thoughts go out to you at Kiel, and again to
Hamburg to your unforgettable father, whose memory is
amongst those most sacred and dear to me. Only one thing
were to be wished as to the charming little packet&mdash;that it
could have smiled at him.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'In warm remembrance and with best greetings</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right:10em">'Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="right" style="padding-right:10%;">'<span class="smcap">J. Brahms</span>.'</p>

<p>When the Janssens settled at Kiel, Brahms wrote to ask
Groth to call upon them, saying:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... The lady is the daughter of my first pianoforte
teacher Cossel of whom I must have told you. And when I
began to speak of him I was certainly unable to leave off
again....'</p>

<p>At the period we have now reached, Brahms had given up
his solitary Christmas evenings. The home of Dr. and Mrs.
Fellinger became every year more and more a substitute to
him in some sort for that home of his own which he imagined,
perhaps, with longing and regret till the last year of his life.
Each Christmas Eve of his last seven winters found him
amongst the Fellinger family group, rejoicing in the joy of the
young people, stimulating their fun, happy in feeling himself
truly one in the midst of a family circle whose greatest delight
it was to know that their friend of friends liked to be amongst
them. Frau Fellinger always contrived some charming
practical joke in the matter of the Christmas presents prepared
for the master, by which he was annually and unfailingly
taken in. One year&mdash;the first Christmas he passed
at the house&mdash;part of her own gift table, labelled with his
name, was tastefully arranged with toilet accessories. In
front of a burnished mirror two candlesticks stood, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
lighted candles; between these was a pincushion, on to
which was pinned a black silk necktie; some parcels with
pink paper wrappings, tied with ribbon and labelled 'Finest
perfume,' lay near. The only uncovered articles were
packets of writing-paper of the kinds most used by Brahms,
supplied in sufficient quantities to last some time.</p>

<p>The usual general survey of the gift-laden tables took
place, and Brahms evinced much sympathetic interest
during the tour of inspection, but presently he walked silently
away to the other end of the room, passing his hand over his
beard, then sauntered back carelessly, only to retire again
and pace about apart, the picture of quiet dismay. 'But
won't you look at your things, Dr. Brahms?' inquired Frau
Fellinger by-and-by, when her guest had summoned sufficient
courage to mingle again with the party and admire the
young people's presents, though he carefully avoided
glancing at his own. Poor Brahms allowed himself to be
led to the table, and stood mute and dazed before it. 'Ah!
<i>here</i> is mine,' he cried, suddenly catching sight of the paper;
'this is for me!' 'But all is for you,' returned his hostess
kindly but firmly. 'But these things are all for you,' said
the master, pleading; 'they are not for me, they are yours.'
'But why, Dr. Brahms?' insisted the lady; 'pray look at
your things; do you not like scent?' By little and little
the master was persuaded to handle his presents, gingerly
enough, it is true. And now ensued the transformation scene.
Each dainty trifle turned into some useful article suited to
Brahms' needs. The two candlesticks became cream-jugs,
the pincushion a sugar-basin, the packets of perfume proved
to be tablets of unscented soap. A bread-basket containing
bundles of English quills such as Brahms always used
for writing music, and a clothes-brush, stood in bare,
attractive reality before his astonished eyes. Soon
nothing remained but the mirror. 'But this really does
belong to you,' he implored, still deceived. 'Look behind
it,' said Frau Fellinger; and the mirror became a nickel
coffee-tray, chosen because of its smooth, brilliantly-polished
back, which had well served the Christmas Eve purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
'Now I really must sit down,' said Brahms, drawing a long
breath, his kind face shining; and he insisted on carrying
away all his things in a cab the same evening.</p>

<p>But though Brahms was persuaded, in the later years of
his life, to join the family festivities of these kind friends,
he kept up to the last his custom of showing himself at his
landlady's Christmas Eve party. Frau Truxa used to light
up her tree an hour or two earlier than formerly, so that he
should feel quite happy in setting out for Dr. Fellinger's.
Of course her two boys were always remembered by the
master, and his gifts to them, generally books, were found
punctually on the table at the hour appointed for the
commencement of the festivity.</p>

<p>The publications of the year 1890 were the 'Fest und
Gedenkspr&uuml;che,' as Op. 109, and three Motets for four and
eight part Chorus <i>a capella</i>, Op. 110.</p>

<p>The writer of these pages was present at a supper-party
given in Vienna in January, 1890, after a concert of the
Joachim Quartet, at which Brahms with Joachim and his
colleagues were the chief guests. 'What shall we have
next?' said Joachim to Brahms in the course of supper;
'a quintet; we have one, a very fine one; we will have
another.' A second string quintet, with two violas, composed
during the summer at Ischl, was the next work produced
by Brahms, and was heard for the first time in public
from the manuscript in Vienna at the Ros&eacute; Quartet concert
of November 11 (Ros&eacute;, Bachrich, Hummer, Jenek, and
Siebert). An anecdote which appears to the author worth
preserving, as expressive of Brahms' appreciation of his
friend's incomparable playing, may find a place here. At
a period when the two men had not met for a couple of years
an occasion came when Brahms heard Joachim play. 'Now,'
he said afterwards to the lady who related the story to the
author, 'now I know what it is that has been wanting in my
life during the past two years. I felt something was missing,
but could not tell what. It was the sound of Joachim's
violin. How he plays!'</p>

<p>Brahms' Quintet in G major is, in the opinion of most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
competent judges, one of the most powerful and fascinating
of his works of chamber music for strings. If there is, in
one or two of his late compositions for pianoforte and other
instruments, something that suggests the feeling that in this
domain the elasticity of his imagination was approaching its
limits, nothing of the sort can be said of either of the works
for strings only, and the Quintet in G is certainly second to
none of them in wealth of spontaneous melody, in vigour
and variety of inventive power, in all, in short, that is
included in the word 'vitality.' To the present writer it
appears quite clear and easy to follow, but that there may
be two impressions on this point is proved in a remarkable
way by two letters written by Billroth, the first to Brahms
himself after the work had been performed for the first time
from the manuscript at a party at Billroth's house, the second
a few months later to Hanslick.</p>

<p>In the letter to Brahms, dated November 6, the
famous surgeon, writing evidently under the influence of
the great artistic excitement of the day, tells the master
that he cannot rest without sending him word of his
delight.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Lately I have been silent, for I know not what more to
say than, wonderfully fine and now clear to me at first
hearing, clear as the blue sky!... Could one compare
the various works of Michael Angelo, Raphael, Beethoven,
Mozart when they were at the height of their powers?
Only in the sense of a limited personal sympathy.... I
have often wondered what human happiness is&mdash;now I was
happy to-day when listening to your music. That is quite
clear to me.'</p>

<p>The following March, however, Billroth wrote to Hanslick
that he found the quintet one of the most difficult of Brahms'
works.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The form, when one has found it out, is simple and clear;
but the length of the first bass theme and the rhythmic and
harmonic over-rich, I might say overladen, five-part development
make enjoyment of the movement [the first] impossible
except under great mental strain. One must be
fresher and better in health for it than I am at present....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>But it is easy to talk; we are always wanting something
new, something which interests us more than the last; no
one can quite satisfy us.'<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Billroth heard the work the first time under the most favourable
imaginable conditions, when his own powers of receptivity
were strongly stimulated. He was depressed and out
of health when he wrote the second letter. The majority of
music-lovers would, we fancy, range themselves on the side
of his original impression. The power and loveliness of the
first movement, the romance of the second (the wonderful
adagio), the plaintive daintiness of the third, the vivacity
of the fourth, tinged with Hungarian colouring, all seem to
foretell a continued prolongation of the composer's creative
force and impulse. That Brahms himself, however, in the
beginning of the nineties was conscious of needing rest is
well known. Billroth says of him in a letter dated May 28,
1890, after visiting him at Ischl:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'He rejected the idea that he is composing or will ever
compose anything. He is deep in Sybel's "Foundation of
the German Empire," three thick volumes and the fourth to
come.'</p>

<p>To another friend Brahms said in 1891: 'I have tormented
myself to no purpose lately, and till now I never had to do
so at all; things always came easily to me.' He professed
his intention of giving his creative activity a rest, and
employing his time in reading, going excursions, and seeing
his friends, but did not at once persevere in the resolution.</p>

<p>In the early part of the year 1891 he paid a visit to
Meiningen. His enjoyment was the greater since the Duke,
to whom the master had often spoken of Widmann, had
invited this gentleman to meet his friend. Several delightful
details of the time are related by Widmann. For us,
however, the fact of particular interest is that it was now
that Brahms' admiration of the performances of the clarinettist
M&uuml;hlfeld, of the Meiningen orchestra, culminated in
the determination to write for his instrument. M&uuml;hlfeld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
had gained particular reputation as a soloist by his performances
of Weber, whose Concertino for clarinet and
orchestra had been introduced by him at Meiningen on
December 25, 1886, the hundredth anniversary of the composer's
birth. Our master, who since that date had had
many opportunities of listening to M&uuml;hlfeld's wonderful
tone and execution, now asked for a private recital with
only himself as audience, in the course of which the clarinettist
played to him one piece after another from his
r&eacute;pertoire, and discussed his instrument with him. The
sequel was the composition by Brahms, during his annual
residence at Ischl, of a trio for pianoforte, clarinet, and
violoncello and a quintet for clarinet and strings. These
works were performed from the manuscripts before the
ducal circle at Meiningen Castle on November 24 of the
same year, the Trio by Brahms, M&uuml;hlfeld, and Hausmann,
the Quintet by the same musicians, Joachim, and two
members of the Meiningen orchestra.</p>

<p>Brahms remained on as the Duke's guest for some little
time after the performance, and then followed his friends
to Berlin in order to take part in the Joachim Quartet
concert of December 12, when his new works were heard
for the first time in public. This occasion was, and has
remained, unique in the history of the famous party of
artists. The Joachim Quartet concerts in Berlin, occupying
a position in the forefront of the musical life of the
city, have now taken place annually for nearly forty years;
but into no other programme than that of December 12,
1891, has a work not written exclusively for strings been
admitted. That Brahms was much gratified by the compliment
paid him is evident from a letter written by him
on December 1 to Hanslick, in which he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... I shall not be able to tell you about it [a performance
of Strauss' opera, 'Ritter Paynim'] for another fortnight.
This is because Joachim has sacrificed the virginity
of his Quartet to my newest things. Hitherto he has carefully
protected the chaste sanctuary but now, in spite of
all my protestations, he insists that I invade it with clarinet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>and piano, with trio and quintet. This will take place on the
12th of December, and with the Meiningen clarinettist. Tell
Mandyczewski (or let him read) that the quintet "adagio
con sordini" was played as long and often as the clarinettist
could hold out.'<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The visit to Berlin resulted in a phenomenal triumph. A
public rehearsal was held on the 10th, when every seat was
occupied, and at the conclusion of the quintet, the last
number of the programme, the audience indulged in an overwhelming
demonstration to composer and executants. They
went so far as to demand a repetition of the entire work, and
Joachim and his colleagues at length consented to repeat
the adagio. A similar scene was enacted at the concert on
the 12th. Both new works were favourably noticed by the
Berlin press, which waxed enthusiastic over the quintet, and
especially the adagio.</p>

<p>The trio was played in Vienna the same month at a
Hellmesberger concert; the quintet on January 5, 1892, by
the Ros&eacute; Quartet party, with the clarinettist Steiner. Both
works were heard again in the Austrian capital a fortnight
later at a concert given there by the Joachim Quartet party,
with the co-operation of Brahms and M&uuml;hlfeld. The quintet
was introduced to a London audience at the Monday Popular
concert of March 28 by M&uuml;hlfeld, Joachim, Ries, Straus, and
Piatti, and repeated at the Saturday concert of April 2, when
the trio was also played by Miss Fanny Davies, M&uuml;hlfeld,
and Piatti.</p>

<p>The Clarinet Trio appears to us one of the least convincing
of Brahms' works, and this in spite of the fact that it bears
its composer's name writ large on every page. No one could
fail to recognise his handwriting in either of the four movements,
and to true Brahms lovers the handwriting must
always be dear; but if one may compare the composer with
himself, the inspiration of this work seems to us to halt, the
spirit to want flexibility. Far otherwise is it with the beautiful
and now favourite quintet, which contains, as Steiner
says, richest fruits of the golden harvest of the poet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
activity. Here 'the brooks of life are flowing as at high
noon,' though the tone of gentle, loving regret which pervades
the four movements, and holds the heart of the
listener in firm grip, suggests the composer's feeling that the
evening is not far away from him in which no man may
work. A fulness of rich melody, a luscious charm of tone,
original effects arising from the treatment of the clarinet,
'olympian' ease and mastery, distinguish every movement
of this noble and attractive work, which, taking its hearers
by storm on its first production, has grown more firmly
rooted into the hearts of musicians and laymen with each
fresh hearing. In the middle section of the second movement
Brahms has written for the clarinet a number of quasi-improvisatory
passages embracing the entire extent of its
compass, which are supported by the strings, and which,
when competently performed, are of surprisingly attractive
effect. A fancy that suggested itself to one of the Berlin
critics, as to the position assigned in this movement to the
clarinet, seems to have commended itself to Brahms, who
was ever afterwards in the habit of introducing the distinguished
artist for whom it was written, to intimate friends,
as 'Fr&auml;ulein von M&uuml;hlfeld, meine Primadonna.'</p>

<p>In 1891 were published the String Quintet in G, Op. 111;
six Vocal Quartets, the last four being additional Gipsy
Songs set to Conrat's texts, Op. 112; and thirteen Canons
for women's voices, the appearance of which forms a direct
link between the composer's late maturity and early youth.</p>

<p>The Clarinet Trio and Quintet and three books of short
Pianoforte Pieces, Op. 116, Nos. 1 and 2, and Op. 117,
appeared in 1892.</p>

<p>Brahms departed in good time in the spring of 1893 for
what was to be his last holiday in the south, meeting
Widmann and two Z&uuml;rich friends (Friedrich Hegar and
Robert Freund) in Milan and proceeding with them to
Sicily, whose scenery and general romantic charm had made
an indelible impression on his mind when he had travelled
in the country with Billroth some fifteen years previously.
He had an additional and weighty reason for desiring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
leave Vienna in April. The coming 7th of May, his sixtieth
birthday, could not fail to be made the occasion, not only
of friendly rejoicings, but, if he were at home, of formal
congratulatory functions in which he would be asked to
take part. To his mind, such a predicament left but one
course open to him&mdash;flight; and for this he had made
arrangement months beforehand. As early as the year
1892 he had refused Hegar's invitation to celebrate his
birthday by some festival performances at Z&uuml;rich in the
following terms:</p>

<p class="blockquot small right">
'<span class="smcap">Vienna</span>, <i>September 29th, 1892</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'I hasten to place this pretty sheet of paper before
me and will endeavour approximately to express my gratitude
to you and your society for your extremely kind and
friendly project for the next 7th May. To-day I will only
say that I have for some time been intending to make a
proposal to you. My indolence in writing is the only cause
that you have been beforehand with me. I wished to ask
you and Widmann if you would not like, as I should, to go
for a little while to Italy?</p>

<p class="blockquot">'When and where is all one to me; if on the 7th of May we
are only safe in the Abruzzi or somewhere else where no one
can find us; if we can only devote ourselves to touching
(and preferably jovial) meditation. You see my plans and
ideas are quite different from yours and my next letter
will contain only many thanks for your very kind thought....'<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>To Herr Ehrbar's annual invitation to the asparagus
luncheon, therefore, which was sent as usual about the
middle of April to No. 4, Carlsgasse, and which contained
a special request that in this particular year the festivity
should be celebrated on May 7 itself, a telegraphic reply
was received from Genoa. The master was very sorry that
he would not be able to be present this year, but sent his
kindest greetings to all friends who should assemble on the
occasion. Instead of postponing the party on account of
this disappointment, Herr Ehrbar decided not only to
gather the old friends about him as usual, but to hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
festivity at the H&ocirc;tel Sacher, and to invite some additional
guests to drink the health of the absent composer, bringing
up the number to about thirty.</p>

<p>Widmann, who had an accident during the return journey
which injured his knee and obliged him to remain for two
days at Naples under the surgeon's care, has thus described
how Brahms spent May 7:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'And so it happened that Brahms passed his sixtieth
birthday in the most quiet seclusion, remaining to watch
faithfully by my bed after we had persuaded our two friends
to make an excursion to Pompeii. The doctor's performances,
which gave me little pain, excited him fearfully,
though he tried to conceal this by making jesting remarks,
as when he muttered grimly between his teeth, "If it
should come to cutting, I am the right man; I was always
Billroth's assistant in such cases." When we were alone
he provided for my comfort like a deaconess and took
pains to keep up my spirits by chatting cheerfully, saying
for instance, "You have already tramped about so much
in the Swiss Alps and Italy. Even if, at the worst, this
should not again be possible, you are much better off than
a hundred thousand others who have not had such opportunity."
... Every now and then whilst he was sitting
with me, congratulatory telegrams arrived from intimate
friends who had obtained intelligence from one or other of
us as to our whereabouts.'</p>

<p>It was rumoured in Vienna, nevertheless, that Brahms
was present at Herr Ehrbar's luncheon; that he was seen
in the Augustinestrasse in the evening of the 6th; that he
astonished his friends by joining them at the H&ocirc;tel Sacher
at twelve o'clock on the 7th, just as they were about to sit
down to table; and that he vanished from the city immediately
after the festivity, to come back no more until the
usual time of his return in October.</p>

<p>The sixtieth birthday of its honorary president was celebrated
by a special meeting and musical performance in the
club-rooms of the Tonk&uuml;nstlerverein, and the Gesellschaft
had a gold medal cast in the master's honour.</p>

<p>A note to Frau Caroline, written in June from Ischl,
headed by a diminutive photograph of himself in walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
dress, is suggestive of Brahms' happy mood at this
time:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Here I come, dear mother, and thank you for your
dear letter.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I am delighted that Fritz [Schnack] is making a nice
tour which shows that you are both well&mdash;let him only
make further plans, and travel!... I will be careful that
you get a cast of the medal. It will interest Fritz as a connoisseur&mdash;he
must imagine the gold. I am very well and
the summer becomes finer every day. In the autumn or
winter I really must look in upon you myself and not
merely in a portrait.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Have you a great deal too much money, or may I send
some? I should like Fritz to spend plenty in travelling
and he can afterwards entertain you and himself again with
his sufferings!...</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right:10%;">
'Your <span class="smcap">Johannes</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
</p>

<p>Years before this date, Frau Caroline had, at the urgent
and oft-repeated wish of Johannes, given up her boarding-house
in the Anscharplatz, and retired to enjoy the remainder
of her life as mistress of her son's quiet home in
Pinneberg. Johannes kept his stepmother supplied with
the necessary funds, which were regularly transmitted to
her through his publisher, Herr Simrock of Berlin; but he
was never tired of urging upon her his readiness to meet
intermediate demands as they might arise, and particularly
of suggesting holiday journeys for Fritz Schnack as a good
way of spending extra money. Frau Caroline and her son,
who both worshipped Johannes, frequently incurred his
displeasure on account of the moderation with which they
availed themselves of his generosity.</p>

<p>He never went to Hamburg after his stepmother's retirement
without reserving a few hours to visit her at Pinneberg,
and there, in the modest little dwelling he had provided,
felt himself, as it were, in the old family home. He would
sit in a corner of the sofa in the room by the side of the
shop filled with clocks whose hands pointed to the right
time and whose pendulums swung cheerily to and fro, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
chat happily with her and Fritz, hearing little items of
domestic news, asking after this and the other acquaintance;
then would suddenly relapse into silence and reverie, which
were unfailingly respected by the two people to whom he
was so dear. By-and-by, after he had arranged his thoughts,
he would come out again from his musing to continue the
pleasant chit-chat where it had been left.</p>

<p>Brahms always expected his stepmother to be present
at his public appearances in Hamburg, and continued to stay
with her, when visiting the city, until she went to live at
Pinneberg. On an occasion of his coming, after her retirement,
to conduct a symphony at one of B&uuml;low's Hamburg
concerts, he took a room for her next his own at the H&ocirc;tel
Moser, that they might be as much as possible together
during the few days of his stay, and led her on his arm to her
seat at rehearsals and concert. Frau Caroline did not,
perhaps, entirely fathom the depths and intricacies of her
stepson's fourth symphony, but she loved the work, and
shared in the joy of it with her whole heart. Fritz, too,
came over from Pinneberg, and greeted his stepbrother in
the artist's room before the concert began. The master's
sister, Elise Grund, died in 1892, and his visit to Hamburg
after her death seems to have been the last known by his
friends to have been paid by him to his native city. He
was at Pinneberg, however, after this date.</p>

<p>Some of Brahms' time at Ischl this summer was given
to the editing of the supplementary volume of Frau Schumann's
complete edition of her husband's works. One cannot
but read in this deeply-interesting book our master's
desire to associate his name once more with those of Schumann
and his wife, especially as he has taken the, for him,
altogether exceptional course of writing and signing the
introductory sentences of its first page. It contains, to
quote Brahms' words,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'a few things found amongst Robert Schumann's papers
which, on account of their value, or of some special interest,
ought not to be omitted from this collection.... The theme
with which the volume concludes is, in a quite peculiar sense,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>Schumann's last musical thought. He wrote it on the 7th of
February, 1854, and afterwards added five variations which
are withheld here. It speaks to us as a kindly greeting spirit
[genius] about to depart and we think with reverence and
emotion of the glorious man and artist.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right:10em;">'<span class="smcap">Johannes Brahms.</span></p>
<p class="right" style="padding-right:10%;"><span class="smcap">Ischl</span>, <i>July 1893</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Of the composer's original work of the season Billroth
writes a few months later to a friend:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Brahms has, so far as I know, composed a dozen pianoforte
pieces during the summer. I do not know the cause
of this sudden passion. I like him least of all in this style,
the G minor Rhapsody excepted. He does not sufficiently
diversify his form in these little works.... He ought to
keep to the great style.'</p>

<p>The pieces in question were published in the autumn in
two books&mdash;Op. 118 and 119. The other publications of
the year, issued without opus number, were the two books
of Technical Exercises for Pianoforte.</p>

<p>Billroth's expression of feeling about the Pianoforte Pieces
will probably be endorsed by many even of the most faithful
admirer's of Brahms' art, whilst all will certainly agree as
to his one exception. Beautiful as many of the intermezzi,
fantasias, etc., are, it is to be doubted whether Brahms'
short compositions for the pianoforte will ever gain such
universal and unreserved affection as has long since been
accorded to those of Schumann and Chopin. The manner
in which the thoughts are expressed sometimes seems out
of proportion to the moderate length of their development,
the height of the structure to be, as it were, too great in
comparison with the superficial area allotted to it. In
several instances at all events, however, this impression is
due to the unusualness of the pieces, and passes away as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
they become really familiar. It is as yet too soon to form
any definite opinion as to the place they may ultimately
take.</p>

<p>True appreciation of Brahms' small as of his great works
is sometimes slow in coming, even to those who love
his music with deepest affection. When, however, from
time to time, the spirit dwelling within his inspirations
reveals itself unsought as in a sudden flash, the whole heart
is apt to go out with complete acceptance to the reception
of its beauty and truth. Only in one instance (Op. 117,
No. 1) has the master given any clue as to the sources
which may have stirred his fancy during the composition
of his thirty short pieces for the pianoforte from Op. 76
onwards, and where he has been reticent it would ill beseem
others to stamp any particular piece with a definite suggestion.
It may, however, be surmised that many of the little
compositions are expressions derived from his passion for
nature. The mountain storm swept up by the wind and
bursting with a sudden crash, the approaching and retreating
roll of its thunder, with the ceaseless pattering of rain
on the leaves; the gay flitting of butterflies; the lazy hum
of the insect world on a hot summer day; the long sweep
of gray waves breaking into foam on the shore&mdash;all may be
found in them. The music of the spheres, also, too ethereal
for the perception of ordinary mortals, has been caught by
our master's ear, and, woven into gossamer sound-textures,
has been conveyed by him to the appreciation of organizations
less delicate than his own. Some of the pieces have
certainly grown up around the fancies of a legend or a
poem. In these we may hear the weird footsteps of the
spirit world, the dread strike of the bell of fate, the catastrophe
of human lives. In no case, however, except in the
one mentioned, are the several works to be taken as having
been associated with this or that in the mind of the composer.
The same one may mean different things to different
people, and Brahms has carefully guarded against the possibility
of being suspected of programme-music by giving
to the Fantasias, Rhapsodies, Ballades, Intermezzi, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
vaguest of all possible titles.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The book Op. 117 has become
really popular, and is sold in the United Kingdom alone in
its thousands. One of the first persons&mdash;perhaps the first&mdash;to
hear books Op. 116 and 117 was Frau Schumann's pupil,
Fr&auml;ulein Ilona Eibensch&uuml;tz (now Mrs. Carl Derenberg), to
whom Brahms played them on their completion, inviting her
especially to hear them.</p>

<p>Asking Brahms to be present in October at a festival
meeting of the Imperial and Royal Society of Physicians,
Billroth says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I should like to see you for once in evening dress [<i>sch&ouml;n
decorirt</i>]. If, however, you object to this, you will find a
place among the younger doctors in the (not high) gallery
in walking costume.'</p>

<p>It was one of the last semi-public functions in which the
famous surgeon took part. His health had for some time
been declining, and he died on February 6, regretted by all
ranks of Vienna citizens. The funeral procession was witnessed
by crowds of people, especially of the poorer classes.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'We do not wear such open hearts,' writes Brahms afterwards
to Widmann, 'nor show such pure and warm affection
as they do here (I mean the people, the gallery)....
In the whole innumerable concourse no inquisitive or indifferent
face was to be seen, but upon each countenance
the most touching sympathy and love. This did me much
good when passing through the streets and at the cemetery.'<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Brahms could not trust himself to remain too close a
spectator of the last scene. Whilst the relatives and friends
of the departed surgeon remained standing round the open
grave, he quietly strolled to a side-walk and paced up and
down, talking with an acquaintance of other matters.</p>

<p>The thought of death had, indeed, a power over the
master which probably held him in its clutch at times
throughout his life. He could not bring himself to face
the enemy with resolute front, especially during his later
years, when the iron hand laid claim to one of his friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
but would speak of the matter as little as might be, and
no doubt kept it as much as possible at bay in his thoughts.
'I do not mean to drink any more coffee,' he said one
day to his landlady in Carlsgasse. 'Why, Herr Doctor,
you enjoy your coffee so much!' exclaimed Frau Truxa,
who had gained an insight into his character, and felt sure
that something lay behind this announcement. 'I have
taken coffee for a long time,' returned Brahms. 'I am
going to leave it off, and drink something else.' A few days
later Frau Truxa heard by chance of the death of a lady
living in Marseilles who had for years kept the master
supplied with Mocha. Nothing more was said, but an arrangement
was made, without Brahms' knowledge, by
which the same supply was to be despatched at the same
interval by her daughter. Coming as it were from the
same hand, Brahms continued to drink the coffee, but without
further comment.</p>

<p>Death had, however, till now been kind to our master,
sparing him the agony of many severe partings. We have
seen his deep grief at the loss of the parents who had loved
him with the entire devotion of their simple, affectionate
hearts. By the nature of things, his sense of bereavement
on the deaths of brother and sister had been less enduring
in its sting. His friend Pohl, librarian of the Gesellschaft,
died in 1887, but with this exception the old circle of chums
remained as it had been. Joachim, Stockhausen, Grimm,
Dietrich, Kirchner, Hanslick, Faber, Billroth, Goldmark,
Epstein, G&auml;nsbacher, all had continued with him, whilst in
Frau Schumann's presence he was at the age of sixty-one
still young, with youthful feelings of veneration in his heart.
The death of Billroth dealt him a severe blow. Who shall
say that even at this time he had not a presentiment that
before very long he was to follow?</p>

<p>If this were so, but little change showed itself in his outward
habits. The pedestrian excursions near Vienna took
place every second or third Sunday as before, and if Brahms,
growing every year heavier, found the ascent of the surrounding
heights more fatiguing than in past years, he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
not openly allude to the fact, but would invite his companions
to pause for a few moments to look at the country,
whilst they, at once acceding to his wish, always carefully
avoided perceiving that he was short of breath. Hugo
Conrat frequently made one of the party of walkers at this
period, and the master was often a guest at his house,
where it is to be feared that Frau Conrat, in no way behind
the rest of his friends, sadly spoiled him. He had become
in these years a complete autocrat in the circles in which
he moved. His comfort was studied, his desires were anticipated,
his witticisms appreciated, his tempers accepted, and
his utterances recognised as final. Brahms enjoyed his
position, and, it must be confessed, did not hesitate to
avail himself of his privileges. On one occasion of a dinner-party,
being asked to escort one of the principal lady guests
to the dining-room, he turned sharply round and offered his
arm to the young governess. On another&mdash;a party at the
Conrats' country house&mdash;finding on his arrival that the cloth
had been laid in the dining-room, and not in the veranda,
he went up to the hostess, saying: 'But it is still fine
weather. I always dine out of doors in October.' The
lady sent word to the kitchen that the dinner was to be put
back for twenty minutes, and, begging her visitors to walk
in the garden meanwhile, gave orders for the alteration of
her arrangements. 'But what did Brahms say when he
found he was causing such trouble?' someone asked Fr&auml;ulein
Conrat afterwards. 'Then he was good again,' she replied.
Such incidents could be multiplied from the experiences of
many of Brahms' friends. They serve chiefly to prove that
the master's mind lost its pliancy as he grew older, and that
he became incapable of adapting himself to circumstances
outside his ordinary routine. His friends accepted his
whims as a part of himself, and, knowing his sensitiveness
to contradiction, did not contradict him. They were aware
that the sterling nature had not really changed, and did
not trouble themselves to criticise the outer crust of irritability
and roughness that sometimes concealed it from the
appreciation of less indulgent observers.</p>

<p>'All that you tell me is very nice,' said Brahms one day
to Herr Conrat's two gifted young daughters, who, paying
the master a visit in his rooms, had been encouraged by
him to talk about the progress of their studies. 'You must
know these things, which are very important; but I will
show you something to be learnt of still greater consequence;'
and he fetched from a drawer an old, worn, folded table-cloth.
'Look here,' said he, showing the two girls some exquisite
darning, 'my old mother did this. When you can do such
work you may be prouder of it than of all your other studies.'</p>

<p>After the completion of the Clarinet Quintet and Trio in
1892, Brahms allowed his mind the refreshment of change
of work. The only original compositions belonging to the
following year are the two books of 'Clavierst&uuml;cke,' Op. 118
and 119, the appearance of which we have already chronicled.
He was, however, engaged with his collection of German
Folk-songs, arranged with pianoforte accompaniment, six
volumes for one voice, and the seventh for leader and small
chorus.</p>

<p>The publication of this valuable work in 1894, almost at
the end of the life of the great musician who compiled it,
adds yet another and most striking illustration to those on
which we have commented, of the general continuity of the
lines on which Brahms' career was shaped. As he began,
so he ended. The boy of fifteen who arranged folk-songs
for practice by his village society, the youth of twenty who
used them in his first published works, the mature master
who returned to them again and again for inspiration and
delight, all live in the veteran of sixty-one, who, as he busies
himself in preparing the unique collection, every page of
which bears mark of his insight, skill, and sympathetic tact,
seems to be looking back over the years of the past with
longing to leave behind him a final sign of his love for his
great nation and all belonging to it. 'It is the only one of
my works from which I part with a feeling of tenderness,'
he said on its completion for the press. A child of the
people by birth, Brahms remained, with all his literary and
artistic culture, a child of the people by sympathy. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
loved, and ever had loved, the simple peasant folk of the
country places where he dwelt, as part of the great life of
nature which was his delight. His partiality for them had
in it something which resembled his feeling for children.
He was pleased with their na&iuml;vet&eacute;, valued their confidence,
and perhaps, idealist as he was, gave them credit for a
genuineness and simplicity not always theirs. In their
songs, it was this same naturalness that attracted him, and
whether in his original settings of national texts, or in his
arrangements of the people's melodies, nearly always, as
we have seen, left the words as he found them in their
spontaneous directness of expression. Writing to Professor
B&auml;chtold, to whom he sent a copy of his collection, he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'... I think you will find some things new to you, for
if you have been interested in the music of our folk-songs,
Erk and now B&ouml;hme will have been your guides? These
have hitherto led the (very Philistine) tone, and my collection
stands in direct opposition to them. I could and should
like to gossip more if I knew that you were interested and
especially if we were sitting together comfortably....'<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Brahms at one time contemplated changing his rather
confined quarters at Ischl, but a feeling of loyalty to the
good folks in whose house he had spent several summers,
and who regarded themselves as having a prescriptive right
to their lodger, asserted its sway over his kind heart. He
returned to them as each succeeding spring came round,
and the little signs that heralded his approach&mdash;the opening
of shutters, the cleaning of windows, and other preparations
visible from outside&mdash;were eagerly looked forward to by
the country people near as the first tokens of the approaching
season.</p>

<p>Frau Gr&uuml;ber's little house, of which Brahms occupied the
first-floor, was built on a mountain slope, and a short flight
of steps at the side led to a small garden furnished with a
grass plot, a garden bench, and a summer-house. Visitors
had to mount the steps, cross the garden, find a second
entrance-door at the back of the house, go in, and knock at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the door of the composer's sitting-room. Sometimes he
would cross the room, open the door, and peep cautiously
out; but more often than not he called out, 'Come in!'
and the visitor stepped at once into his presence. He laid
strict injunctions on his landlady, however, that the door
of his rooms was to be kept locked and the key in her possession
whenever he was out, and that on no account was
she to allow anyone even to peep into the room containing
his papers and piano. If he once found out that she had
disregarded this rule, once would be enough for him; that
very day he would pack up and leave her, never to return.
It was a most necessary precaution to take, for numerous
visitors of either sex who were unknown to him found their
way to the house, and would gladly have sought consolation
for their disappointment at not seeing him by inspecting
some of his belongings.</p>

<p>One or other of his friends frequently called for him about
half-past eleven, and soon afterwards he would start out
and gradually make his way to the H&ocirc;tel Kaiserin Elisabeth.
Between two and three o'clock he usually made his appearance
on the promenade by the side of the river. Stopping
at Walter's coffee-house, he would seat himself at a table
under the trees outside, where a cup of black coffee and the
daily papers were at once brought to him. Here he generally
remained for at least an hour, and sometimes it was much
longer, to be joined by one friend and another till his party
numbered a dozen or more. Walter's became, indeed, at
this hour of the day, a rendezvous not only for Brahms'
personal friends, but for many musical visitors to Ischl who
did not know him, but who heard that they could easily get
a sight of him there. He was very particular in acknowledging
the greetings of his numerous acquaintance as they
passed along the promenade, and, owing to his anxiety to
be courteous and his near-sightedness combined, he sometimes
made a mistake and bowed to people whom he did
not know.</p>

<p>'Oh, if you had only been with us this afternoon!' a
friend and fellow-lodger said to the author one day in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
summer of 1894. 'Paula and I were walking on the promenade,
and we met Brahms, who greeted us so kindly.
He waved his hand, and looked round, saying, "Good-day!
good-day!" Of course I returned his greeting. I wonder
if it could have been because he was pleased with my little
Paula? He takes so much notice of children.' Frau F. was
far too much gratified by the incident to accept the author's
opinion that it was a case of mistaken identity, as Brahms
was not in the habit of consciously bowing to strangers.</p>

<p>Herr Oberschulrath Wendt, of Carlsruhe, when staying at
Ischl, was daily to be seen in the master's company, and
the two men, both of striking appearance, presented a
singular contrast as they paced side by side along the
promenade. Wendt, tall, thin, and pale, was delicate-looking,
and walked with a slight stoop. Brahms, rather short,
very stout, with a good deal of colour, probably acquired
by exposure to the weather, that seemed the more pronounced
from its contrast with his white hair and beard,
went along with head well thrown back, the very personification
of vigour. On leaving Walter's he generally betook
himself to a friend's house, most frequently that of Johann
Strauss. To his intimacy there the world is indebted
for some of the best of his late photographs&mdash;those of
Krziwanek, of Vienna and Ischl&mdash;which were taken one
afternoon in the summer of 1895 as he was sitting at ease
with his friends.</p>

<p>Brahms knew, and was well known to, all the children of
the neighbourhood, and when starting on his country walks
would fill his pockets with sweetmeats and little pictures,
and amuse himself with the eagerness of the small barefooted
folk, who knew his ways and would run after him
as he passed, on the look-out for booty. 'Whoever can
jump gets a gulden,' he would say; and, displaying beyond
reach of the little ones a handful of sweetmeats made in
imitation of the Austrian coin, he would increase his speed,
and raise his hand higher and higher, drawing after him the
flock of running, leaping children, until he allowed one and
another to gain a prize.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Two Sonatas for clarinet and pianoforte, the last works
of chamber music composed by Brahms, were completed
during the summer of 1894, and towards the end of September
M&uuml;hlfeld arrived at Ischl to try them with the composer.
The first private performance took place very soon
afterwards, when the two artists played them before the
ducal circle of Meiningen at the palace of Berchtesgarten.</p>

<p>A reunion at Frankfurt in November is of pathetic interest.
It carries us back to the very early pages of our narrative,
and is the last complete one of the kind we shall have to
record. For the last time we find Frau Schumann and
her husband's and her own two dearest musician-friends
assembled and making music together. Brahms arrived at
her house on a few days' visit on the 9th of the month; on
the 10th M&uuml;hlfeld spent the evening there, having come
from Meiningen at the composer's especial request, and the
new works were played to the illustrious lady, 'the revered
Frau Schumann,' as Brahms used to call her to his younger
friends, who had now completed her seventy-fifth year.
The next day Joachim, prince of violinists at sixty-three as
at twenty-one, the age at which he entered these pages, gave
a concert with his colleagues of the Quartet, and on the 12th
there was a party at Herr and Frau Sommerhoff's, when
Brahms and M&uuml;hlfeld again played the two Sonatas, and
Frau Schumann, Joachim, and M&uuml;hlfeld, Mozart's beautiful
Clarinet Trio, a favourite work of Brahms. The reunion of
old friends was completed by the presence of Stockhausen,
who, like Frau Schumann, had been resident in Frankfurt
since 1878. On the 13th, the third Frankfurt performance of
the Clarinet Sonatas by Brahms and M&uuml;hlfeld took place at
a large music-party at Frau Schumann's, and another
memorable item of the evening's pleasures was the playing
by Frau Schumann and M&uuml;hlfeld of Schumann's Fantasiest&uuml;cke
for pianoforte and clarinet. Joachim had left to
fulfil other engagements before the evening, and Brahms
departed on the 14th.</p>

<p>The master's journeys and performances with M&uuml;hlfeld
gave him extraordinary pleasure, and the publication of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
two sonatas, which in the usual course of things would have
taken place in the autumn of 1894, was delayed until the
summer of 1895, that his possession of the manuscripts
might be prolonged. Both works were performed at the
Ros&eacute; concerts, Vienna, by the composer and his friend&mdash;No.
2 in E flat on January 8, 1895, when the Clarinet Quintet
was also played; and No. 1 in F minor at an extra concert
on January 11, the programme of which included the
G major String Quintet. Amongst other towns visited by
Brahms and M&uuml;hlfeld in the month of February were
Frankfurt, Rudesheim, and Meiningen, and the master was
seen for the last time in public by his Frankfurt friends on
the 17th, when he listened to a performance of his D major
Symphony, and conducted his Academic Overture at a
Museum concert. The two sonatas were performed for
the first time after publication at Miss Fanny Davies'
concert of June 24 in St. James's Hall, London, by the
concert-giver and M&uuml;hlfeld, engaged expressly to come to
England for the occasion. The manuscripts of both works
are in the possession of M&uuml;hlfeld, to whom the composer
presented them on publication, with an appreciative autograph
inscription.</p>

<p>With the publication of the two Clarinet Sonatas, our
master's career is all but closed, and closed as we would have
it. The more familiar they become, the more firmly will
they root themselves, as we believe, in the affection of the
lovers of his music. The fresh, bounding imagination of
youth is, indeed, not in them, nor would we wish it to be
there; but both works are pervaded by a warmth and glow
as of sunset radiance, which, reflecting the spirit of the composer
as he was when he wrote them, fill the mind of the
listener with a sense of the mellow beauty, the rich pathos,
the unwavering sincerity of his art. To compare the two
sonatas one with the other is unnecessary. We prefer
simply to commend them to the study of those of our readers
to whom they are not entirely familiar, holding them, as we
do, to be amongst the especially lovable examples of the
late period of Brahms' art.</p>

<p>But few events remain for record in the life which we have
now followed step by step nearly to the end of its progress.
Of these few, several have the pathetic interest of last visits
to dear and familiar places made, so far as appears, without
presentiment that they were final. The composer was
present at a three days' festival held in Meiningen September
27-29; 'the Festival of the three B's,' as it has sometimes
been called, from the circumstance that the programmes
were devoted to works by Bach, Beethoven, and
Brahms. Those of Brahms selected for performance included
the Song of Triumph, the fourth Symphony, the
B flat Pianoforte Concerto, with d'Albert as pianist, the
Clarinet Sonatas performed by the same artist with M&uuml;hlfeld,
some of the Vocal Quartets, amongst them the early favourite
'Alternative Dance Song,' and others.</p>

<p>The festival was an immense success, and the pleasure
which the master derived from the concerts is evident in
the following lines written to Steinbach immediately after
the last one:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquot">'However tempted I may feel, I dare not break in
upon your well-deserved rest; but you shall find my hearty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>greeting awaiting you on your happy awakening; how
hearty and grateful it is there is no need to tell you in detail.
You must have perceived each day that you gave me and all
who took part in your splendid festival, a quite exceptional
pleasure....'<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Brahms was, of course, a guest at the castle, and he remained
on for a few days after the last concert. Leaving
Meiningen on October 3, he proceeded to Frankfurt on a
flying visit to Frau Schumann. Professor Kufferath of the
Brussels Conservatoire, with Mr. and Mrs. Edward Speyer,
accompanied him on the short journey, and were, by his
particular suggestion, invited to spend the evening at Frau
Schumann's house. Professor Kufferath, a pupil of Mendelssohn
at Leipzig, and on a very old footing of intimacy at
the Schumanns', had been for more than twenty years on
terms of cordial friendship with Brahms also, though the
two men met but seldom. Frau Schumann's daughters
Marie and Eug&eacute;nie, and Stockhausen, were the only others
present. The hours were spent in pleasant chat as between
old friends, and music was represented only by a few of
Brahms' folk-songs sung by Mrs. Speyer (Fr&auml;ulein Antonia
Kufferath) to the master's accompaniment.</p>

<p>Brahms left the next morning, but before his departure
he requested his old friend to play to him. Forty-two years
had passed since Schumann had desired him to play for the
first time to her, marking both musicians with inevitable
outward signs. The traces of suffering and sorrow had
deepened of late on Frau Schumann's countenance, but those
who were happy enough to listen to her playing at this
period, in the privacy of her home, knew that her spirit was
still young, and Brahms' last remembrance of the great
artist, the remembrance of an old age which had left the
poetry of her genius untouched, will have fitly completed
the long chain of personal associations begun when Schumann
called his wife to rejoice with him in the daring power
and romantic enthusiasm of Johannes' inexperienced youth.
When she rose from the piano on that October morning, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
final link had been added. Frau Schumann and Brahms
were not to meet again on earth.</p>

<p>A four days' festival in October (19-22) to celebrate the
inauguration of the new concert-hall at Z&uuml;rich seems to
carry us more than one stage nearer the end. It brought
Brahms for the last time to Switzerland to conduct his
Triumphlied; a fine close&mdash;for as such it may almost be
regarded&mdash;to a noble career.</p>

<p>Let us pause for a moment to picture the robust figure of
the composer as he stands before the vast audience completely
filling the brilliantly lighted hall, and leads with
sure, quiet dignity the 'masses of chorus and orchestra'
that swell out in proud tones of thankfulness for his country's
glory. Listen! for with the sounds of the grand old hymn
'Now thank we all our God' the bells of victory are pealing,
and a sensation of happiness spreads through the mass of
hearers, a vibration that stirs something of the feeling
which roused the great German audience at Cologne to
enthusiasm as they listened twenty years ago to the same
jubilant tones. Who so fitted to raise the strain as the
patriot citizen of ancient Hamburg, the unique descendant
of the mighty Bach, the musician of true, rich, loving spirit,
conqueror of life and of himself, our Johannes Brahms?
Conqueror, too, of death; for surely we cannot be mistaken
in accepting the likeness of the master, that looks down with
those of the greatest of his art from the painted ceiling of the
new hall, as the symbol of a further life to be his even here
on earth, when he has entered the darkness that is soon to
cover him from our sight.</p>

<p>Brahms was in overflowing spirits during the entire
festival, enjoying the concerts, the private gatherings, the
meetings with old friends, in a mood of harmless gaiety that
recalls the Detmold days.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'We have seen Brahms and Joachim together again, both
in full vigour; may we not hope for a prolongation of this
happy state of things?' writes Steiner a few days after the
festival.</p>

<p>Widmann was, of course, there, and stayed with Brahms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
at Hegar's house. When he bade the master farewell on
the day after the concert, the two friends clasped hands in a
final grasp.</p>

<p>One of Brahms' late public appearances was on the
occasion of the concert given in the B&ouml;rsendorfer Hall,
Vienna, by Signorina Alice Barbi (now the Baroness Wolff
Homersee) shortly before her marriage. He pleased himself
by acting as accompanist to the distinguished cantatrice,
whose programme included a number of his songs. He held
the b&acirc;ton for the last time on a Vienna platform when he
directed the performance of his Academic Overture by
the students of the conservatoire at the festival concert given
to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary (1895) of the
opening of the present home of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde.
He officiated for the last time in public at
d'Albert's concert in Berlin of January 10, 1896, conducting
his two Pianoforte Concertos and the Academic Overture,
and was received with the usual enthusiasm. Stanford
speaks of being present at a dinner-party given by Joachim
during Brahms' brief visit.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Joachim, in a few well-chosen words, was asking us not
to lose the opportunity of drinking the health of the greatest
composer&mdash;when, before he could say the name, Brahms
started to his feet, glass in hand, and calling out "Quite
right; here's to Mozart's health," walked round clinking
glasses with us all. His old hatred of personal eulogy was
never more prettily expressed.... The last vision I had
of him was as he sat beside the diminutive form of the aged
Menzel, drinking in, like a schoolboy, every word the great
old artist said with an attitude as full of unaffected reverence
as of unconscious dignity.'</p>

<p>Of all modern painters, Adolph von Menzel was the most
admired by Brahms. He visited him on several occasions,
and spoke of him and his works with unfailing enthusiasm.</p>

<p>That the master had realized a competence some years
before his death&mdash;more than a competence for one of his
extraordinarily simple habits&mdash;is generally known. How
he regarded it, how he used it, may have been but little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
suspected outside a small circle. His friend and publisher,
the late head of the firm of Simrock, shared his confidence on
the subject more than anyone else, for it was often through
his agency that Brahms' munificence was applied to its
object; the substantial help, perhaps, of a needy musician,
or a promising talent. He contributed more than one large
donation to the 'Franz Liszt Pensionsverein' of Hamburg,
a society founded by Liszt in 1840 for the benefit of aged or
disabled members of the Stadt Theater orchestra. Several
authentic stories are told by accidental witnesses of some of
his particular acts of generosity. One has been related to the
author by the Landgraf of Hesse, who was sitting with the
master one morning when a caller appeared with a tale of
distress which touched his heart. He listened quietly, asked
some questions, then went to his writing-table, and, handing
his visitor the entire sum of money towards which he was
asked for a contribution, said quietly, 'Take this from me;
I do not need it. I have more money than I want for myself.'
This was his usual formula on such occasions, 'I do not
need it,' to which was sometimes added, 'If you should
ever have it in your power, you can pay me back.'</p>

<p>Brahms' heart was of gold, if ever such existed. He was
rough sometimes&mdash;often, perhaps&mdash;let it be freely granted.
The spoiled humours of his last two or three years have
already been noted; they do not amount to much. He
permitted himself deliberately to repulse strangers or slight
acquaintances when he felt so disposed; necessarily, if his
time and tranquillity were to be protected. Now and then
he was inconsiderate or blunt to his friends. The concentration
of mind, the sacrifice of immediate inclination, the
devotion of energy, involved in the fulfilment of the career
of genius are often but imperfectly realized even by the
friends of a famous man. The great poet, the great painter,
the great musician, has his brilliant rewards. He has also
his bitter disappointments, and one of the hardest of these&mdash;which
is especially apportioned to the lot of the creative
musician&mdash;is the discovery that, as in the case of other princes
and sovereigns of the world, his path in life must be solitary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Brahms may sometimes have imagined he had reason for
his impoliteness; more frequently a gruff manner, an awkward
joke, was the result of a constitutional want of presence
of mind in trifling matters, which frequently caused
him to be misunderstood. His real attitude is expressed
in a note published after his death by Hanslick in the <i>Neue
Freie Presse</i> article from which we have already more than
once quoted.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Hanslick had sent him a packet of letters to
read, and had inadvertently enclosed in it one from a mutual
friend which contained a comparison of Beethoven and
Brahms. In it were these words:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'He is often offensively rough to his friends like Beethoven,
and is as little able as Beethoven was to free himself entirely
from the effects of a neglected education.'</p>

<p>Hanslick was very much upset on remembering what he
had done, and immediately wrote to Brahms to throw himself
on his mercy and beg his silence on the matter. The
master immediately answered:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'You need not be in the least uneasy. I scarcely
read &mdash;&mdash;'s letter, but put it back at once into the cover,
and only gently shook my head. I am not to say anything
to him&mdash;Ah, dear friend, that happens, unfortunately,
quite of itself in my case! That one is taken even by old
acquaintances and friends for something quite different from
what one is (or, apparently, shows one's self in their eyes)
is an old experience with me. I remember how I, startled
and confounded, formerly kept silence in such cases; now
however, quite calmly and as a matter of course. That
will sound harsh or severe to you, good and kind man&mdash;yet
I hope not to have wandered too far from Goethe's saying,
"Blessed is he who, without hate, shuts himself from the
world."'</p>

<p>Brahms was ready for another journey to Italy in the
spring, but Widmann was unable to accompany him, and
he passed his sixty-third birthday anniversary in Vienna.
When it dawned, the work that was for a short time generally
accepted as his swan-song had been completed. Deiters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
writes that the immediate occasion of the composition of
the 'Four Serious Songs' was the death of the artist Max
Klinger's father, which occurred earlier in the year. The
not unnatural assumption that has sometimes seen in
these solemn utterances of the great composer a presentiment
of his own fast-approaching end may or may not
represent a fact. It has not been accepted by those of his
friends amongst whom he passed the last few months of his
life, and certainly nothing that is known of his individuality
lends likelihood to the notion of his going out, as it were,
to meet the thought of his death. On the other hand, his
repeated assertion that the songs had been composed for
his own birthday points to the possibility that his mind
may have been under the influence of forebodings of which
he was, perhaps, but vaguely conscious. 'Yes, Gr&uuml;ber, we
are in the front line now,' he said to his landlord on hearing
of the death of some of the old people in the course of one
of his last summers at Ischl.</p>

<p>The 'Four Serious Songs' were published in the summer
of 1896 with a dedication to Max Klinger, his personal
friend, of whose work, including that inspired by his own
compositions, he became a warm admirer, though he at
first disliked the painter's 'Brahms Fantasie.'</p>

<p>Three of the songs deal grimly with the thought of death
(Eccles. iii. 19-22, iv. 1-3; Ecclus. xli. 1, 2); the fourth has
for its text St. Paul's beautiful glorification of love (1 Cor.
xiii. 1-3, 12, 13):</p>

<p class="blockquot">'<i>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
as the one dieth, so dieth the other, for all is vanity....</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">'<i>Though I spake with the tongues of men and of angels,
and had not love, I should be as sounding brass or a tinkling
bell....</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">'<i>We see now through a glass, in a dark word, but then face
to face. Now I know it partly, but then I shall know it as I
am known.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">'<i>Now remain faith, hope, love; but the greatest is love.</i>'</p>

<p>It is certain that Brahms speaks to us in the songs from
the depth of his convictions. Herr Geheimrath Dr. Engelmann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
arrived one evening in the course of the summer on
a day's visit to Ischl. Brahms called at his hotel at six
o'clock the next morning, and after breakfast brought his
friend back to his rooms, where they spent several hours
together. The composer was in delight over some lately-arrived
volumes of the complete edition of Schubert's works,
then in progress, and could not sufficiently express his joy
in their contents. 'See here,' he said, with his energetic
enthusiasm, as he pointed to one place after another with
beaming face and lightening eyes&mdash;'see here, what a splendid
fellow he was! People talk of him as a mere melodist, but
look what material he had even in his early works; look
what the melodies are, how they grow.' By-and-by, taking
up a copy of the 'Four Serious Songs,' he said: 'Have
you seen my protest? I wrote these for my birthday.'</p>

<p>The explanation of these words is that the master viewed
with mistrust, or even dislike, modern efforts to revivify
and popularize the services of the Evangelical Church by
the introduction of sacred musical works composed for the
purpose, of which those of Heinrich von Herzogenberg may
be taken as the type. Brahms, who subscribed to no
church dogmas, regarded this tendency as artificial, and
therefore as weak and unhealthy, and much as he admired
Herzogenberg's powers, he regretted that they were dominated
during the last ten years of his creative activity by
his strong ecclesiastical bias.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Brahms' love of the Bible
and his preference for Scriptural texts was, as we know,
not that of what is conventionally called a 'pietist.' He
spoke in the language of the people's book as a realist who
was at the same time an idealist. He has so arranged the
texts of his German Requiem that it would be difficult
to construe the work as the embodiment of a definite belief,
and he expressly refused to enlarge it into an account of
the Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Christ; and yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
as we have endeavoured to show, it contains the presentiment,
the inspiration, of something positive. From Brahms'
standpoint the attempt to go behind the mysteries of life
and death, to construct the unspeakable, the unthinkable,
into verbal formul&aelig;, is not only predoomed to failure, but
is almost irreverent. Yet, as we may remember, 'he had
his faith,' and if anything may be judged of it from the
story of his life, the spirit of his works, this faith lay in
acceptance of the immutability of truth, the sacredness of
life, and the sovereignty of love.</p>

<p>Brahms had been settled in his rooms at Ischl scarcely a
fortnight, when he was profoundly shaken by the tidings of
Frau Schumann's death. She passed away peacefully at
her home in Frankfurt on May 20, in the seventy-seventh
year of her age, and was laid to rest by her husband's side
at Bonn on Whit Sunday, May 24. The story of her life,
triply crowned by fame, love, and sorrow, remains amongst
the ideal possessions of the world.</p>

<p>A great crowd of musicians and friends assembled at the
funeral, those of Frankfurt, Bonn, and Cologne being strongly
represented. The custom of the ceremony had changed
with time since Johannes had borne Frau Clara's laurel-wreath
to Schumann's grave, and on the conclusion of the
service, which consisted of the singing of chorales and an
address by Dr. Sell of Bonn University, more than two
hundred floral tributes were piled up around the spot.
Joachim with Herzogenberg, bound by Italian engagements,
had attended a service held in the Schumanns' house at
Frankfurt. Woldemar Bargiel and Bernhard Scholz were
at the cemetery, and of our own particular musicians, Stockhausen
and Brahms. Another last meeting.</p>

<p>On the termination of the service, Brahms, whose agitation
had been very unpleasantly heightened during his journey
from Ischl by the delay of a train, and his consequent
anxiety lest he should be late, went to Honnef to stay till
the next day with Herr and Frau Wehermann, the near
relatives of his Crefeld friends, the von Beckeraths and von
der Leyens, who were at the time on a visit there. Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Richard Barth and his wife, Dr. Oph&uuml;ls, and two of
the Meiningen musicians, Concertmeister Eldering and Herr
Piening, were also of the party. The master was very much
excited and overcome on his arrival at Honnef, but the
soothing influence of the Rhine country, so closely associated
with the recollections of his youth, did him good,
and he prolonged his visit to nearly a week. Confiding to
Barth the day after his arrival that he had with him something
new, which he would like to play very quietly to one
or two chosen listeners, his three most intimate friends
retired with him to a room secure from interruption, impressed
by his manner with the feeling that something
unusual was about to ensue. When the little party had
taken their places, Brahms, with every sign of the most
profound emotion, which communicated itself to his companions,
played through the 'Four Serious Songs' from the
manuscript. 'I wrote them for my birthday,' he said in
the same words which he afterwards used to Dr. Engelmann.
He then played some new organ preludes.</p>

<p>He was agreeably interested in Dr. Oph&uuml;ls' project of
arranging a collection of his composed texts. 'I have often
wished for such a thing, for though I do not care to look
closely at my music, it would be quite pleasant to recall it
now and then by reading the texts.' The collection was
completed during the ensuing months, and the manuscript
placed in the master's hands.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Brahms at Dr. Fellinger&#39;s, June 15, 1896.</span><br /><i>Photograph by Maria Fellinger.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Brahms appeared unannounced in Vienna in the middle
of June to take part in the family celebration of Dr. and
Frau Fellinger's silver wedding day. Returning immediately
to Ischl, he spent the next few weeks in his usual
fashion, though neither mind nor body really recovered the
double shock of Frau Schumann's death and of the anxious
journey to Bonn. He occupied himself still with his art,
and on June 24 had completed seven organ preludes, which
he played to Heuberger on that date at Ischl. 'Splendid
pieces,' says Heuberger's diary; and in another entry, dated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
July 5: 'Brahms' things must have been sent away already,
for he has promised to show me <i>new</i> compositions.'<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> These
were, no doubt, some more preludes. Eleven were found
after Brahms' death, the last four being written on a different
kind of paper from that used for the first seven.</p>

<p>The 'Elf Chorale-Vorspiele' (Eleven Chorale-Preludes)
for organ are instrumental movements founded, as their
name implies, upon some of the grand old church tunes for
which Germany is famous. They are worked in florid
counterpoint in a style which may be studied, also, in the
organ preludes contained in the third volume of the Leipzig
Society's edition of Bach's works, and are written with an
ease to which no other composer than Brahms has attained
in this style since Bach's day. That the great modern
master had studied it during the years of his retirement
in the fifties, before he was in possession of the Society's
volumes, seems certain, from the fact that three old books
of Bach's Chorale-Preludes once belonging to Brahms are
still in existence. One, bearing Brahms' pencil autograph,
is in manuscript, possibly that of his father or brother;
the others are early published editions.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The majority of the chorales selected for treatment in
1896 have death for their subject, and are written in the
profoundly serious vein to which we are accustomed in the
composer's sacred works. The fourth prelude, 'Herzlich
thut mich erfreuen,' is in a somewhat lighter vein than the
others, but is, none the less, absolutely and distinctly Brahms.
One of the most delicately touching is the eighth, 'Es ist
ein Ros' entsprungen.' 'Herzlich thut mir' is the subject
of two of the movements, 'O Welt ich muss dich lassen'
of two, of which one is the eleventh and last.</p>

<p>It is impossible that we can be mistaken in accepting the
Chorale-Preludes, together with the 'Four Serious Songs'
which immediately preceded them, as indicating the bent
of the composer's thoughts during his last year of life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
we involuntarily apply to them the words, quoted in the
preceding chapter, used by Brahms in reference to Schumann's
theme. They speak to us 'as the message of a
spirit about to depart, and we think with reverence and
emotion of the glorious man and artist.' Nevertheless, a
note written by the composer to Frau Caroline on August 13
contains little sign of his depressed condition. It opens
with charming, simple comments on his stepmother's last
little budget of home news, urges a tour in Norway and
Sweden on Fritz Schnack&mdash;'it would give me real pleasure
if he would do it, and tell me all about it afterwards'&mdash;and
ends:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The summer is not exactly fine, but whoever, like myself,
rises early and can go out walking when he will, may
be content and there are innumerable beautiful walks here.
I hope you will continue so well and write sometimes to</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right:10%;">
'Your heartily greeting <span class="smcap">Johannes</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>It had not escaped the notice of Brahms' friends, however,
that his ruddy complexion had changed to a yellow colour,
and some of them were courageous enough to speak to him
about his health, and urge him to consult a doctor. At first
he showed much annoyance when the subject was broached,
and turned it off impatiently with the reply that, as he never
used a glass, he did not know how he looked. But the
uneasiness felt about his condition increased, and he was at
length persuaded to seek medical advice in Vienna. The
doctor whom he consulted did not issue an alarmist report,
but, pronouncing him to be suffering from jaundice, ordered
him to Carlsbad for the 'cure.' Much against his will, the
master, who hated the very idea of waters and cures, and who
prided himself on never having being ill in his life, gave up
some pleasant Ischl engagements, and started on September 2
for Carlsbad. He was met at the station by two friends of
Hanslick, Herr Emil Seling and Musikdirektor Janetschek,
who took him to the 'Stadt Brussels,' near the Hirschensprung.
Here, during the fine autumn days which succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the wet summer, he made himself content, and even wrote
cheerful reports to his friends, in which he expressed satisfaction
at having been obliged to make the acquaintance of the
celebrated watering-place. He was the object of much considerate
and respectful attention, which seemed to cheer
him; and Faber came to be near him, accompanied him in
his daily walks, and took tender care of him.</p>

<p>The report written to Hanslick by the distinguished Carlsbad
physician Dr. Gr&uuml;nberger, after three weeks' careful
observation, was ominous. There was considerable swelling
of the liver, with complete blocking of the gall-passages,
and the inevitable results&mdash;jaundice, indigestion, etc. The
eminent medical authority could not but regard the condition
of his patient as 'very serious.'</p>

<p>No more definite name was given to the malady on the
master's return to Vienna after some six weeks' treatment
at Carlsbad, and his request that he should be told 'nothing
unpleasant' was scrupulously observed. He went about
as before, dining more frequently, however, with his most
intimate friends the Fellingers, Fabers, Millers, Conrats,
Strauss' and von Hornbostels, and often accepting the
offer from one and another of a seat in a box at the Burg
Theater. He became very testy if asked how he was or
if told that he looked better, and answered to every inquiry,
'Each day a little worse,' but continued in letters to his
stepmother and other friends at a distance to keep up the
fiction that he was suffering from an ordinary jaundice which
only needed patience. Those who loved him, however,
looked with dismay at the alteration that was taking place
in his appearance. The yellow colour, which had been the
first striking symptom of his condition, was changing gradually
to a darker hue, the bulky figure shrinking to terrible
emaciation; the firm gait was beginning to falter, the head
was no longer held erect. A visit to Vienna, early in
December, of Joachim and his colleagues of the Quartet
gave him touching pleasure; he was with them as much as
possible during the day, and generally remained with them,
after attending their concerts, until late at night. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
continued to take interest in important new compositions,
and begged Hausmann to come to his rooms to play him
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's Violoncello Concerto. He accompanied the entire
work on the piano, and broke into enthusiastic admiration
at the end of each movement, exclaiming after the last
one, 'Had I known that such a violoncello concerto as that
could be written, I would have tried to compose one
myself!'</p>

<p>He not only spent Christmas Eve with the Fellingers, but
invited himself to dine with them also on December 25, 26,
and 27. Frau Fellinger gave him a 'secco,' a soft, short
coat, as one of her Christmas presents, and it seemed a sort
of comfort to him to put it on when he was at the house,
where it was kept in readiness for his use, and to sit quietly
in the family sitting-rooms without need of exerting himself.
After dinner on the 27th he raised his glass, saying, 'To
our meeting in the New Year,' but by-and-by added, pointing
downwards, 'But I shall soon be there.' He dined again
on New Year's Day with the same dear friends, whose joy
it was to feel that they were privileged to afford him some
solace in his weakness and suffering.</p>

<p>The Joachim party returned to Vienna after a tour in the
Austrian provinces, and gave two concluding concerts in the
B&ouml;rsendorfer Hall on January 1 and 2, 1897. Ill as he was,
Brahms not only attended both concerts, but came on the
morning of the 2nd to Joachim's rooms at the H&ocirc;tel Tegethof
to listen to the rehearsal of his G major Quintet, which was
in the evening's programme. He derived peculiar pleasure
from hearing it. 'That is not a bad piece,' he said, as though
half ignoring that it was his own. The scene which took
place after the performance of the work in the evening is
remembered with emotion by those who took part in it. It
was the final one in the friendship of Brahms and Joachim&mdash;a
friendship as striking and interesting as any contained in
the history of art. Its character may be suggested to the
reader's imagination in a few words written to the author
by the great musician whose love and recognition Brahms
enjoyed from beginning to end of his career.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'He had great pleasure that evening in the G major
Quintet. It was touching to see him come before the public
to acknowledge the enthusiasm aroused by his work. The
tears were in his eyes and he was very weak. The people
cheered and cheered endlessly.'</p>

<p>Thus the master's state gradually changed for the worse.
He dined with the Fellingers in the middle of the day on
February 7, and seemed excited and restless throughout the
meal. When it was at an end, he intimated that he wished
to be alone with Dr. and Frau Fellinger, and, retiring with
them, began to speak about his affairs. He desired, he said,
to make a new will, but dreaded the necessary formalities
to such a degree that he knew not how to resolve to go
through them. Would it not be possible to arrange his
affairs quietly without having to speak about them with
strangers? Dr. Fellinger said it could be done, and that by
the Austrian law things could be so managed that there need
not even be witnesses. The master remained for four hours&mdash;from
two till six o'clock&mdash;with Dr. and Frau Fellinger,
discussed his affairs in minute detail, and asked Dr. Fellinger
to be his curator. He seemed relieved at the end of the conversation,
and stayed on with the family, chatting about
other topics. The following morning Dr. Fellinger took to
the composer at his rooms in Carlsgasse the copy of a will
which he had drawn out to meet Brahms' expressed desires,
and explained to him that he had only to write it out himself,
date and sign his name to it, and it would be valid according
to Austrian law. Brahms, who was on the point of starting
out to his dinner, expressed himself as glad and relieved, and
placed the paper in a drawer of his writing-table; and
Dr. Fellinger, pleased to have cheered him, returned home
with the conviction that he would copy it without delay.
The master did not return to the subject at any future
meeting with his friends, whilst they, believing the matter
to have been finally settled, did not again allude to it.</p>

<p>February passed, and Brahms grew continually worse.
Every day he spent a good deal of time in looking through
and destroying old letters and other papers. 'It is so sad,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
he would say, when one or other intimate friend called and
found him thus employed, his stove filled with ashes. He
attended the Philharmonic concert on March 7, when
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's Violoncello Concerto, played by Hugo Becker,
and his own fourth Symphony in E minor were in the programme.
Going into the concert-room he met his old
friend G&auml;nsbacher. 'Ah,' he said, 'you have been so often
to see me, and I cannot go to you, I am so suffering;' then,
rousing himself a little, went on, 'You will hear a piece
to-day, a piece by a man!' (Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's concerto).</p>

<p>The fourth symphony had never become a favourite work
in Vienna. Received with reserve on its first performance,
it had not since gained much more from the general public
of the city than the respect sure to be accorded there to an
important work by Brahms. To-day, however, a storm of
applause broke out at the end of the first movement, not to
be quieted until the composer, coming to the front of the
'artists'' box in which he was seated, showed himself to
the audience. The demonstration was renewed after the
second and the third movements, and an extraordinary scene
followed the conclusion of the work. The applauding,
shouting house, its gaze riveted on the figure standing in the
balcony, so familiar and yet in present aspect so strange,
seemed unable to let him go. Tears ran down his cheeks as
he stood there shrunken in form, with lined countenance,
strained expression, white hair hanging lank; and through
the audience there was a feeling as of a stifled sob, for each
knew that they were saying farewell. Another outburst of
applause and yet another; one more acknowledgment from
the master; and Brahms and his Vienna had parted for
ever.</p>

<p>Brahms appeared after the concert at a luncheon-party
given by Excellenz Dumba, a distinguished protector of art
in Vienna. About twenty-five gentlemen, chiefly artists
and art-lovers, and the ladies of the house were present.
Brahms was placed near to several of his intimate friends&mdash;Epstein,
Conrat, Hanslick, G&auml;nsbacher, and Mandyczewski&mdash;but
he was not able to remain long. Within a few days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
of this date his Ischl landlady received a postcard from him
announcing his intention of going to Ischl earlier than usual,
and desiring that his rooms might be got ready. The last
opera he heard was his friend Goldmark's 'Das Heimchen';
he entered a theatre for the last time on March 13, sitting
with Hanslick at the production of Johann Strauss' 'Die
G&ouml;ttin der Vernunft,' but was obliged to leave at the end of
the second act, and, much against his will, suffered a friend
to accompany him home in a cab.</p>

<p>From this time he grew rapidly worse. He complained
that he could no longer remember what he read, but wished
for Busch's 'Bismarck,' the last book with which he tried
to occupy himself. He soon became unable to take a walk
even in a friend's care, and Dr. Victor von Miller called every
day in his carriage to take him to drive in the Prater, where
the fresh air somewhat revived him. His strength of will
remained phenomenal to the last. He dragged himself to a
rehearsal of the Roeger-Soldat Quartet party held at Frau
Wittgenstein's less than a fortnight before his death, to hear
Weber's Clarinet Quintet with M&uuml;hlfeld's co-operation. A
performance of the work at Meiningen had particularly
pleased him, and its inclusion in the Soldat programme was
by his suggestion. In the same week he paid his last visit
to the Fabers, and, whilst ascending the staircase to their
flat, nearly fainted with pain. Herr Faber revived him,
and got him on to the drawing-room sofa, where he sat
exhausted, his head on his breast. He was obliged to leave
the family dinner-table of some other intimate friends, and,
retiring to the next room, sank down in agony. Frau
Fellinger was ill at this time, and unable to leave her room.
Brahms' last call of inquiry at her house was made on
March 19.</p>

<p>The master was very gentle during the last months of his
life, and touchingly grateful for every attention shown him.
His evenings were of necessity passed in his rooms, for he
firmly refused all the entreaties of his friends that he would
take up his abode in one or another house. Every evening
at dusk he used to place himself at the piano, and improvise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
softly for about half an hour, and when too tired to continue,
would sit by the window gazing out on the familiar scene
till long after darkness had set in. On March 24 Frau Door,
who had always been a favourite with him, called to take him
a bunch of violets. She was not admitted, but, observing
Dr. von Miller's carriage before the house door, waited near
the entrance, hoping to see Brahms pass out. He came
down in about half an hour leaning on his friend's arm,
and, noticing Frau Door, gave her his hand. 'I am very
ill' (Mir geht es sehr schlecht), he answered faintly to her
inquiry. He did not go out again. The next day Conrat
was admitted, and was sitting talking quietly with him, when
Brahms, who was on the sofa smoking, suddenly dropped
his head. 'There must be something in it,' he muttered.
Conrat gently left the room without disturbing him. On the
26th the physician wrote word to Frau Fellinger that all
chance of moving him was over. Brahms did not leave his
bed again. His two or three closest friends were constantly
at his side, whilst his landlady, Frau Truxa, was his faithful
and devoted nurse. He spoke little during the last days,
and was too weak to notice much of what was passing in his
room, but he managed on the 29th to write a few pencil
lines from his bed to Frau Caroline:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'D. M. For the sake of change I am lying down a little
and cannot, therefore, write comfortably. Otherwise there
is no alteration and as usual, I only need patience.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right:10%;">
'Affectionately your <span class="smcap">Joh</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>A few more weary days and nights, during which the
beloved master's life ebbed rapidly away, bring us to the
early morning of April 3. He had lost consciousness several
times in the night and been restored, and had recognised
Faber, who, calling at about six o'clock and performing some
slight service for him, caught the whispered words, 'Du bist
ein guter Mensch' (You are a kind man). It is now nearly
nine o'clock, and Brahms has fallen asleep. Early messages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
of inquiry have been answered, and the doctor, who has been
at hand during the night, has departed, promising soon to
return. The day has begun with the bright spring promise
that the master was wont to greet year after year with joyful
welcome; the sun shines, a soft breeze enters through the open
window; outside there is a twittering of birds. Near the bed
sits the untiring nurse, noticing the signs of the fast-approaching
end. A movement from the bed claims her assistance.
Brahms has opened his eyes, and tries to raise himself.
With Frau Truxa's help he attains a sitting posture, and,
looking at her, tries to speak. The lips move, but the tongue
has lost its power, and he can only utter an inarticulate
sound. Great tears roll down his cheeks; a last sigh, a last
breath, and he sinks back, supported by gentle hands, on
to his pillow, rid of his sufferings, passed quietly to his
rest.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Dr. von Miller, whose house was in the vicinity, was the
first of the friends to receive intelligence of the master's
decease. He hurried at once to Carlsgasse, and was immediately
joined by Dr. Fellinger and Herr Faber. Many
others called during the morning, some of whom were
admitted to look at the still features, smoothed by the caress
of death into an expression of noble serenity. A sketch was
taken by the painter Michalek, a mask by Professor Kundemann,
a photograph by a private friend. The cause of
death was certified, after a medical examination of the
remains, as degeneration of the liver. The body, in evening
dress, was placed the same afternoon in the coffin, and the
room arranged with candelabra containing lighted candles;
on a crimson cushion were displayed the various orders of
the deceased composer. The next day the arrival began of
the flowers, wreaths, crosses, and other floral tributes that
transformed the room into a temple of beauty.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 4th General-Secretary Koch,
Dr. Fellinger, and Herr Faber met in the dwelling, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
searched for a will in the presence of a notary, but only
found one written in May, 1891, on two sheets of paper, the
last of them signed and dated, in the form of a letter to
Simrock. This, a legally competent document in its original
form, except for the slight omission of the signature on the
first sheet of paper&mdash;which, under the indisputable circumstances
establishing the authenticity of the will, would not
have rendered it invalid&mdash;had been returned to the master
at his own request by Simrock some time subsequent to
the death of his sister, Elise Grund, in 1892. It was found,
however, to have been marked by Brahms in pencil, some
of the clauses lined out, whilst notes in the margin indicated
designed alterations. These were in exact correspondence
with the wishes expressed by Brahms in February to Dr. and
Frau Fellinger, and embodied by Dr. Fellinger in the paper
he had delivered into the hands of the composer to be
copied by himself and signed. Another search was made
the next day, therefore, but it proved fruitless. Only
Dr. Fellinger's manuscript was found, and it must be presumed
that Brahms had put off the dreaded task from day
to day in the hope of feeling more capable of it, until his
strength was no longer equal to its fulfilment. Nothing
remained, therefore, but to apply to the proper authorities
for the nomination of a curator in order that the necessary
arrangements might be proceeded with. This was done;
Dr. Fellinger was appointed, and on the afternoon of the
5th the sitting-room which, with the small inner room
leading from it, contained Brahms library, manuscripts,
and other possessions, was formally sealed. The coffin was
closed the same day.</p>

<p>As soon as the master's death became known, the offer of
an honorary grave was made by the city of Vienna. There
was no hesitation in accepting it, but a deliberation was held
as to whether the remains should be taken direct to the
Central Friedhof or should be cremated at Gotha, according
to directions contained in the letter to Simrock, and the ashes
only deposited in Vienna. The remembrance of a few words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
dropped by Brahms himself when speaking of the 'sacred
spot' which contains the graves of Beethoven and Schubert
decided the point. It was felt that he would have chosen to
rest in the place selected for him: the particular garden of
the Friedhof in which the remains of Beethoven and
Schubert lie, and which is sacred also to the memory of
Mozart.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'All musical Vienna accompanied the great dead to the
grave on the afternoon of April 6 and a stranger not knowing
the man's greatness might have measured it by the
number of prominent artists mingling in the great assemblage
of the funeral procession, by the celebrated men and
women who came from afar to show the last honour to
Brahms.'</p>

<p>Till the hour appointed for the commencement of the
ceremony deputations continued to arrive, from various
parts of Europe, from the numerous societies of which the
composer had been an honorary member, and telegrams
and messages to pour in. At one o'clock a deputation from
the Hamburg Senate was admitted to the house to lay a
magnificent wreath on the coffin side by side with that from
the Corporation of Vienna. Wreaths had been sent by the
Queen of Hanover, the Duke of Cumberland, the Princess
Marie of Hanover, Duke George of Saxe-Meiningen, the
Princess Marie of Saxe-Meiningen, Helene, Baroness von
Heldburg, and innumerable private friends known and
unknown to Brahms; by the Society of Plastic Arts, Committee
of the Opera, Gesellschaft, and other societies of
Vienna; by the Philharmonic Society, Society of Music-lovers,
Cecilia Society of Hamburg; by the Royal Academy
of Arts, Berlin; by the various musical societies of
Berlin, Leipzig, Budapest, Cologne, Salzburg, Mannheim,
Frankfurt, Jena, Laubach, Lemberg, Graz, St. Petersburg,
Brussels, Amsterdam, Cambridge, Basle, Z&uuml;rich, and
many other towns. Six cars scarcely sufficed to hold
them.</p>

<p>The arrangements of the public funeral with which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
city of Vienna honoured the remains of the great composer
formed a singular contrast to the simplicity which had
marked the daily habits of his life. Details may be read
in the journals of the time. We shall confine ourselves to
the record of a few of those appropriate to our narrative.
The cort&egrave;ge, followed by the long train of mourners, started
from Carlsgasse about half-past two, and, proceeding
to the building of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde,
halted before the principal entrance, where arrangements
had been made for a short ceremony, consisting of an address
by Herr Direktor J. R. Fuchs, of the conservatoire, and the
singing of Brahms' part-song 'Fahr'wohl,' for unaccompanied
chorus, under the direction of Richard von Perger,
conductor of the Singverein. The procession then passed
on to the Evangelical Church in Dorotheenstrasse, where
the clergy and choir and several of the city dignitaries
were assembled. After the coffin had been carried into the
church, the choir sang Mendelssohn's 'Es ist bestimmt in
Gottes' Rath.' The funeral address was delivered by Dr.
von Zimmermann, who especially dwelt on the inspiration
derived by the deceased composer's art from the pages of
the Bible, on his love for children and the childlike spirit,
and on his sympathy with distress.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Wherever he could bring support to the unknown
sufferer, the laborious striver, the helpless, the dying, there,
in the man who, in his own habits, was frugal to the verge
of parsimony, was found the most eager benefactor. The
master Johannes Brahms is not dead. His spirit has conquered
death and has entered into the light and blessed
world of the pure harmonies of peace.'</p>

<p>At the entrance to the Friedhof the coffin was surrounded
by personal friends of the deceased composer, carrying
lighted wind-torches, and was accompanied by them to the
grave. They were Ignaz Br&uuml;ll, Anton Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, Arthur
Faber, Dr. Fellinger, Robert Fuchs, Richard Heuberger,
Max Kalbeck, Ludwig Koch, Eusebius Mandyczewski, Dr.
von Miller-Aichholz, Richard von Perger. At the grave-side
Dr. von Perger spoke a few words of last farewell:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'This sacred place is now to receive the mortal remains
of our great contemporary. He who has so enriched and
blessed the whole world, what has he been to us musicians!
In the light which streamed from his creative genius, his
penetrating art-comprehension, we were able to look up
confidently to his incomparable mastership, to his lofty,
unbending artistic intelligence. Amid the countless paths
and by-paths which to-day intersect the domain of musical
art, we were guided by the torch held high and secure by
the hand of her first priest. He has met his worthy spiritual
brothers, indeed, for the first time to-day in this resting-place,
but he was always a simple, sympathetic friend to
his living colleagues in art, in spite of the great distance
which raised him above them; always a helper of uprising
talent, a sure and faithful friend in adversity and suffering....
Here thou restest now, thou blessed of heaven, in
this vast, awful world-solitude; clouds of light float above
thee and that of thee which is immortal floats with them
through eternal spaces. Ade Meister Johannes, fahr'wohl,
fahr'wohl.'</p>

<p>Joachim was in England at the time of Brahms' death,
fulfilling long-contracted engagements. Stockhausen, now
a man of seventy-three, and not in strong health, was at
this period unequal to a hurried and distressing journey
from Frankfurt to Vienna.</p>

<p>Memorial performances were given by the Cecilia Verein,
Hamburg, on April 5, the day preceding the funeral; by the
Vienna Gesellschaft on the 11th; by the Beethoven-Haus
Verein, Bonn, in May; by the Royal High School for Music,
Berlin, in the summer; and by innumerable musical societies
of Europe and America during the season 1897-98. In
nearly all instances the German Requiem formed part of
such concerts as were orchestral.</p>

<p>A clause in Brahms' will provided that any of his unpublished
works found in his rooms after death should be the
property of Simrock. There was one opus only&mdash;the eleven
Organ Preludes. With them were the arrangements, as
pianoforte duets, of Joachim's two overtures referred to in
an earlier chapter. All three works were published in 1902,
a delay of five years having been caused by difficulties that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
arose in connection with the will. Apart from detail, these
may be generally stated as follows:</p>

<p>Brahms is said to have left, besides his library, which
included valuable autograph musical manuscripts, and a
very few personal possessions, about &pound;20,000 in investments.
In the original will three societies&mdash;the Liszt Pensions-Verein
of Hamburg, the Czerny Verein and the Gesellschaft
der Musikfreunde of Vienna&mdash;were named as the
inheritors, subject to the payment of a legacy to the composer's
landlady, Frau Truxa, and of two life-annuities&mdash;one
to his stepmother, Frau Caroline Brahms, to be continued
after her death to her son, Fritz Schnack, for his life;
the other to Brahms' sister, Elise Grund. These would
practically account for the time being for the income arising
from the investments.</p>

<p>In the absence of any legally valid document, about twenty
cousins of various degrees of kinship came forward, in answer
to advertisements in the newspapers, as claimants to the
property. Litigation ensued, and was protracted through
several years. The original process and the first appeal
were determined in favour of the societies; the second
appeal reversed these decisions, and declared the blood
relations to be the heirs. To prevent the further expense
and delay of another appeal, a compromise was now arrived
at by the contending parties, and the general results of the
will, the law-processes, and the compromise have been that
the blood relations have been recognised as the heirs to all
but the library, which is now in the possession of the Gesellschaft
der Musikfreunde; that Frau Truxa's legacy has
been paid; and that certain sums accepted by the societies,
by which they will ultimately benefit, have been invested,
and the income arising from them secured for the payment
of the life-annuity to Herr Schnack. (Frau Caroline
Brahms died in the spring of 1902.)</p>

<p>Projects for the erection of memorials to the master in
Hamburg, Vienna, and Meiningen, were set on foot soon
after his death. The first to be completed has been that
now standing in the 'English Garden' at Meiningen, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
unveiling of which was made the occasion of a Memorial
Festival in October, 1899. The bust of the master which
it displays is the work of Professor Hildebrandt.</p>

<p>The memorial erected at the grave by the heirs, after the
final settlement of the property, designed and executed by
Fr&auml;ulein Ilse Conrat, was unveiled on May 7, 1903, the
seventieth anniversary of Brahms' birth. It consists of a
marble bust and pedestal in front of a marble headstone, on
which are allegorical figures in bas-relief.</p>

<p>Memorial tablets have been placed by the respective
municipalities on the houses in which Brahms lived in
Vienna, Ischl, and Thun, and the garden of the house at
M&uuml;rz Zuschlag has been bought by the town and made into
a music-garden. A bronze bust of the master by Frau Dr.
Fellinger stands in the musicians' pavilion.</p>

<p>A Brahms-Haus has been erected by Dr. von Miller-Aichholz
in his private grounds at Gm&uuml;nden, the rooms of
which are constructed to the exact dimensions of those
occupied by Brahms in Ischl, and furnished with the Ischl
furniture as it used to stand. They contain an interesting
collection of musical and other autographs of the master,
photographs, programmes, and other mementos.</p>

<p>A Brahms Society has been formed in Vienna for the
purpose of collecting and preserving all available mementos
in a special museum.</p>

<p>Our task is now completed. If it should prove to have
been so far successfully accomplished as to suggest to our
readers at all a true conception of the character and individuality
of Brahms, to throw some additional light upon
the spirit which dictated the composition of his works, our
aim will have been achieved. It is as yet far too soon to
attempt any surmise as to the exact ultimate place that he
will occupy amongst the great ones of his art. Schumann's
words, however, spoken rather more than half a century
ago, which proclaimed Johannes as the prophet destined
to give ideal presentment to the highest spirit of his time,
have, even now, been surely proved true. Brahms stands immovable
in his position as the representative of the musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
thought of the ages as it has gradually developed through three
hundred and fifty years from Palestrina's day to his own;
and in his works dwells the high and beautiful spirit&mdash;the
essential spirit of life&mdash;which, whilst it knows no compromise
with truth, works out its appointed course in 'faith and
hope and love, these three; and the greatest of them
is love.'</p>

times referred, speaks of the festival banquet as having taken place at the
Hamburger Hof, Hamburg, and 'as I think' after the performance of
Brahms' symphony. Groth's articles were written in the year 1897, when
he was at an advanced age&mdash;he was much Brahms' senior&mdash;and his
memory has misled him in one or two of his details. As regards those
here referred to, the author has, in the above description, followed the
accounts given in the <i>Hamburger Correspondenten</i> of the time, with
which that of Hanslick, in his very interesting 'Essays on Music and
Musicians,' is in strict accord.</p></div>

<p class="center big">THE REMINISCENCES OF<br />
LADY RANDOLPH CHURCHILL.</p>

<p class="center">By Mrs. GEORGE CORNWALLIS-WEST.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Second Impression.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Demy 8vo. With Portraits.</i> <b>15s. net.</b></p>

<p>The title of this delightful book gains point from its contents.
Mrs. George Cornwallis-West is unable to bring her recollections
down to the immediate present, and so she brings them to a close
when she ceased to be Lady Randolph Churchill. But that was only
a few years ago, and it is doubtful whether any volume of reminiscences
of Society has ever described the life of the interesting and
distinguished people so close to our own day.</p>

<p>Lady Randolph Churchill's earliest experiences were in Paris
during the last gay days of the Empire and the horrors of the
Franco-German War. Then came her marriage and introduction to
all that was best and highest in English Society. In 1876 Lord and
Lady Randolph accompanied the Duke of Marlborough to Dublin,
and her account of life at the Viceregal Court is full of entertainment.
Then come recollections of political society in London, of the
formation of the Primrose League, and anecdotes of well-known
politicians, such as Mr. Balfour, Sir William Harcourt, Mr.
Chamberlain, and others.</p>

<p>Lady Randolph visited the Royal Family both at Windsor and
at Sandringham: she has also many interesting glimpses to give
of Continental Society, including an audience of the Czar in Russia,
Court functions at Berlin, a dinner-party with Bismarck, a friendship
with General Boulanger. Such are some of the varied items that
catch the eye as one turns over the pages. They are samples from
a mine of well-chosen topics, handled with tact, courage and grace.</p>

EIGHTEEN YEARS IN UGANDA<br />
AND EAST AFRICA.</p>


<p class="center">By the Right Rev. ALFRED R. TUCKER, D.D., LL.D.,<br />
<span class="smcap small">Bishop of Uganda</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>With 60 Full-page Illustrations from the Author's Sketches, several of them<br />
in Colour, and a Map. In Two Volumes. Demy 8vo.</i> <b>30s. net.</b></p>

<p>This is a book of absorbing interest from various points of view,
religious, political and adventurous. It will appeal to the Churchman
and philanthropist as a wonderful record of that missionary work,
of which Mr. Winston Churchill has recently said:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'There is no spot under the British Flag, perhaps in the whole
world, where missionary enterprise can be pointed to with more
conviction and satisfaction as to its marvellous and beneficent
results than in the kingdom of Uganda.'</p>

<p>It will interest the politician as a chapter of Empire-building, in
which the author himself has played no small part. Lastly, it will
delight all those who travel or who love reading about travel. The
Bishop describes his wanderings, mostly afoot, through nearly 22,000
miles of tropical Africa. He tells of the strange tribes among whom
he dwells, of the glories of the great lakes and the Mountains of the
Moon. He tells of them not only with the pen, but also with pencil
and brush, which he uses with masterly skill.</p>

<p class="center big">ON SAFARI.</p>

<p class="center">Big-Game hunting in British East Africa, with Studies in Bird-Life.</p>

<p class="center">By ABEL CHAPMAN, F. Z. S.,<br />
<span class="small"><span class="smcap">Author of</span> '<span class="smcap">Wild Norway</span>,' '<span class="smcap">Bird-Life of the Borders</span>,' '<span class="smcap">Wild Spain</span>,' <span class="smcap">etc</span>.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>With 170 Illustrations by the</i> <span class="smcap">Author</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">E. Caldwell</span>. <i>Demy 8vo.</i><br />
<b>16s. net.</b></p>

<p>The author of this fascinating book is a well-known ornithologist,
as well as a mighty hunter and traveller. He takes us 'on safari'
(<i>i.e.</i>, on trek) through a new African region&mdash;a creation of yesterday,
Imperially speaking, since British East Africa only sprang into
existence during the current decade, on the opening of the Uganda
Railway. 'The new Colony,' he says, 'six times greater in area
than the Mother Island, is an Imperial asset of as yet unmeasured
possibilities, consisting, to-day, largely of virgin hunting grounds, unsurpassed
on earth for the variety of their wild fauna, yet all but unknown
save to a handful of pioneers and big-game hunters.' Much
knowledge, however, can be acquired through the pages and pictures
of this book, describing, as it does, the vast tropical forests, with
their savage inhabitants and teeming animal life. The numerous
illustrations of African big game, owing to the expert knowledge of
both author and artist, are probably the most accurate that have ever
appeared.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Denny 8vo. With Portraits.</i> <b>12s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>One of the most brilliant men of his day, only prevented,
probably, by the physical infirmity of near-sightedness, from being
also one of the most prominent, gives us in this volume a collection
of remarkably interesting reminiscences, which extend over half a
century. They include, mostly in anecdotal form, life-like portraits
of the author's father, the first Baron Tollemache (another Coke of
Norfolk, but with more eccentricities), and of Dr. Vaughan of Harrow.
The author's years at Harrow, of which he records his memories,
were from 1850 to 1856, and those at Oxford from 1856 to 1860.
The book contains, besides, a number of characteristic stories, now for
the first time given to the public, of the Duke of Wellington, Lord
Houghton, Lord and Lady Mount Temple, Fitz-James Stephen, to
take but a few names at random from these fascinating pages.</p>

<p class="center big">IN SEARCH OF A POLAR<br />CONTINENT.</p>

<p class="center">By ALFRED H. HARRISON, F. R. G. S.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Illustrated from Photographs taken by the Author in the Arctic Regions,<br />
and a Map. Derry 8vo.</i> <b>12s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>The white North continues to exert its magnetism upon British
explorers. Mr. Harrison's object was to explore the unknown region
off the North American Coast of the Arctic Ocean, but he first
travelled 1,800 miles by waterway through Northern Canada, till he
arrived at the delta of the Mackenzie River. There he was frozen in
and delayed for three months. He then continued his journey to the
Arctic Ocean with dogs, but was obliged to abandon his supplies.
He hoped to obtain provisions at Herschel Island, but being disappointed
in this, he went into the mountains and spent two months
with the Eskimo, whose manners and customs he describes. He
next returned to Herschel Island and made a voyage to Banks Land
in a steam whaler. There, too, the failure of an expected tender to
arrive from San Francisco again defeated his hopes of procuring
supplies. Consequently he once more threw in his lot with the
Eskimo, between the Mackenzie Delta and Liverpool Bay, and spent
a year among them.</p>

<p>Such are the adventures described in this interesting book, the last
chapter of which, explaining the author's plans for resuming his
enterprise, once more illustrates the fact that an Englishman never
knows when he is beaten.</p>

<p>This sumptuous volume, which gives the history of one of the
oldest and most famous fishing clubs, on that finest of all English
streams, the Test, forms an unique addition to angling literature.
The effect of angling on literature has always been genial and
discursive, and these delightful Chronicles are no exception to the
rule. They throw much light on the changes which have affected
social habits in general, and the craft of fly-fishing in particular,
during the best part of a century. They contain not only records of
sport, but various contributions&mdash;literary and pictorial&mdash;to the club
album, made by celebrated members and visitors. These included
Penn's well-known fishing maxims, some portraits by Chantrey, several
sketches by Landseer and Sir Francis Grant, and one precious
drawing from the hand of Turner. In the leisurely old days of mail-coaches,
the members of the club and their guests had more time for
such diversions, when the weather was unfavourable to sport, than
is the case in the present age of telegrams and express trains.</p>

<p class="center big">IN OLD CEYLON.</p>

<p class="center">By REGINALD FARRER,<br />
<span class="small"><span class="smcap">Author of</span> '<span class="smcap">The Garden of Asia</span>.'</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>With numerous Illustrations. Demy 8vo.</i> <b>12s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>The shrines of Oriental romance have once more charmed the pen
of Mr. Reginald Farrer. His book has little concern with modern
Ceylon, its industries and exports. He tells rather of the bygone
glories and sanctities of ancient Lanka, when the island was the seat
of a powerful monarchy and a dominant church. He gladly deserts
the beaten track for the fastnesses of the jungle and the great dead
cities whose bones lie lost in a shoreless ocean of green. Under his
guidance, all those who love contemplation of 'old unhappy things
and battles long ago' can follow the tale of the Buddhist hierarchy
and the Cingalese monarchy, realizing their ancient glories amid the
ruins where they lie buried, and their final tragedy in the vast jungle
that now for many centuries has engulfed their worldly majesty.</p>

<p>Nor is the interest of the book wholly antiquarian and historic, for
Ceylon&mdash;that Eastern Island of Saints&mdash;is a vast flowering garden, of
whose blossoms and paradises all votaries of horticulture will delight
to read in Mr. Farrer's pages.</p>

<p class="center">Edited by EDGAR SYERS.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Fully illustrated. Dewy 8vo.</i> <b>15s. net.</b></p>

<p>Every winter more and more visitors are attracted to Switzerland,
the Tyrol, and Scandinavia, to take part in the various winter sports
of which this book is the first and only comprehensive account in
English. Each sport is dealt with separately by an expert. Thus,
Mr. and Mrs. Syers write on Skating, Mr. C. Knapp on Tobogganing,
Mr. E. Wroughton on Ski-running, Mr. Bertram Smith on Curling,
Mr. E. Mavrogordato on Bandy, and Mr. Ernest Law on Valsing on
Ice. The various chapters give instructions in practice, rules, records,
and exploits, as well as useful information as to hotels, hours of
sunshine, the size and number of rinks, and competitions open to
visitors at the different centres. The book contains a large number
of original illustrations. It should be indispensable, not only to
experts in the various sports, but to the far larger class of holiday-makers
who engage in them as a pastime.</p>

<p class="center">A Record of Mountain Travel in Garhwal and Kashmir.</p>

<p class="center">By A. L. MUMM,<br />
<span class="small"><span class="smcap">Late Honorary Secretary of the Alpine Club</span>.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Magnificently illustrated with Photogravure Plates and Panoramas, and<br />
a Map. Royal 8vo.</i> <b>21s. net.</b></p>

<p>The first and principal portion of this volume contains an account
of a journey through the mountains of Garhwal made by the author
in May, June, and July, 1907, with Major the Hon. C. G. Bruce and
Dr. T. G. Longstaff, whose names are already well known in connexion
with Himalayan mountaineering. The tour has considerable
geographical interest, which is enhanced by a magnificent series of
original photographs of scenes never before submitted to the camera,
and it was rendered memorable by the fact that in the course of it
Dr. Longstaff reached the summit of Trisul, 23,415 feet above the
level of the sea, the loftiest peak on the earth's surface whose actual
summit has, beyond all doubt or question, been trodden by man.</p>

<p>Later on, Major Bruce and Mr. Mumm proceeded to Kashmir,
where they climbed Mount Haramukh, whose snowy crest is familiar
to all visitors to 'the happy valley'; and made a 'high-level route'
down the range of mountains which separates Kashmir from Kagan.
Their photographic spoils were of an interest hardly inferior to those
of the Garhwal journey.</p>

<p class="center big">PAINTING IN THE FAR EAST.</p>
<p class="center">An Introduction to the History of Pictorial Art in Asia, especially
China and Japan.</p>

<p class="center">By LAURENCE BINYON.</p>

<p class="center"><i>With 31 Full-page Illustrations in Collotype from Original Chinese and<br />
Japanese Pictures. One Volume. Crown 4to.</i> <b>21s. net.</b></p>

<p>This important book is a pioneer work in the artistic interpretation
of the East to the West, and in the breaking down of the spiritual
barriers between them. For a basis of study of Eastern art, writes
Mr. Binyon, 'the public at present has nothing but a few general
misconceptions.' He therefore puts forward his volume with the
modest hope that it 'may not be thought too presumptuous an
attempt to survey the achievement and to interpret the aims of
Oriental painting, and to appreciate it from the standpoint of a
European in relation to the rest of the world's art. It is the general
student and lover of painting,' he continues, 'whom I have wished to
interest. My chief concern has been, not to discuss questions of
authorship or of arch&aelig;ology, but to enquire what &aelig;sthetic value and
significance these Eastern paintings have for us in the West.'
Besides its stimulating artistic criticism, the book is full of interesting
glimpses of Eastern history and thought in so far as they have
affected art, as well as of biographical sketches of Eastern painters.</p>

<p>Among the victims of the French Revolution, perhaps the figure
which excites most sympathy is that of the modest and heroic Princess
whose life is told in this deeply interesting memoir. Madame Elizabeth
was the sister of Louis XVI. Her life was at first one of calm
and quiet. Her studies, her charities, and her intimate friendships
filled her time until the storm broke over France, and she left her
peaceful Montruil to take her part in the dangers and sufferings of
her family, and to be their consoler in the time of trial. It was not
till the King and Queen had both been executed that Madame
Elizabeth was brought from prison, tried for corresponding with her
brother, and condemned to the guillotine.</p>

<p>The fresh documents lately discovered by M. Lenotre have
enabled the author, who, by the way, is a great-granddaughter of Sir
Walter Scott, to throw much new light on the life of 'The Angelic
Princess.'</p>

<i>Also an Edition de Luxe, limited to 250 copies, at</i> <b>&pound;2 2s. net</b>.</p>

<p>This work is the outcome of a desire to produce a volume worthy
in every respect of the beautiful gardens of Scotland. Sir Herbert
Maxwell, whose knowledge of the subject is probably unique, is
personally acquainted with the places described, and has throughout
been in consultation with the artist, Miss Wilson. Visitors to her
studio in Edinburgh, or the exhibitions of her work in London, will
need no further testimony to the charm of her pictures, which are
here reproduced with the utmost care and on the largest feasible
scale.</p>

<p>One of the objects of the work is to dispel certain popular fallacies
as to the rigours of the Scottish climate. Its chief aim, however, is
to present a typical selection of Scottish garden scenes representing
all styles and all scales, modest as well as majestic, and formal as
well as free, so that the possessor of the humblest plot of ground
may be stimulated to beautify it, with as fair hope of success, in
proportion, as the lord of many thousand acres.</p>

<p>Like most hobbies, rock-gardening provides an endless topic of
interest for its devotees, and the lore of the subject is inexhaustible.
At any rate, Mr. Reginald Farrer, who is a recognized authority on
the art, by no means exhausted his stock of information and anecdote
in his previous work, 'My Rock Garden.' That garden, as most of
his fellow-enthusiasts know, is on the slopes of Ingleborough in
Yorkshire, and it is a place of pilgrimage for the faithful of this cult.
As a writer, Mr. Farrer combines a light and genial style with sound
practical information, so that his books are at once readable and
instructive. Some idea of the scope of the present volume may be
gained from the list of chapters, which is as follows: 1. Of Shrubs
and their Placing. 2. Of Shrubs, Mostly Evergreen. 3. Ranunculace&aelig;,
Papaverace&aelig;, Crucifer&aelig;. 4. A Collecting Day above
Arolla. 5. Between Dianthus and Epilobium. 6. From Epilobium
on through Umbellifer&aelig; and Composit&aelig;. 7. Of Odd Treasures.
8. The Big Bog and its Lilies. 9. The Greater Bog Plants. 10. Iris.
11. The Mountain Bog. 12. More of the Smaller Bog Plants.

THE HISTORY OF THE 'GEORGE'<br />WORN ON THE SCAFFOLD BY<br />KING CHARLES I.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Finely illustrated in Collotype. Royal 8vo.</i> <b>7s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>A 'George,' in the sense in which it is here used, is the jewelled
pendant of St. George and the Dragon which is worn by Knights of
the Garter. There are two of these 'Georges' used in the Insignia
of the Order. One is attached to the collar, and is worn only on
solemn feasts: the other is called 'the lesser George,' and is worn on
general occasions, attached to a chain or lace of silk.</p>

<p>The sovereign is, of course, head of the Order, and Charles the
First was wearing his 'George' when he ascended the scaffold to be
executed. The question afterwards arose as to what had become
of it, and it has since been given up as lost. Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey,
however, who has already, in his book on Maria Stella,
proved himself a skilful literary unraveller of historical mysteries,
makes out a very good case, in his new volume, for identifying the
missing 'George' with one that is now in King Edward's possession
at Windsor.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Illustrated from Sketches by the</i> <span class="smcap">Author</span>, <i>etc. Crown 8vo.</i> <b>6s. net.</b></p>

<p>The Rev. C. H. S. Matthews, better known in the bush of New
South Wales as 'Brother Charles,' is one of the founders and chiefs
of an Anglican Society called the Brotherhood of the Good Shepherd,
formed to minister to the religious needs of those remote regions.
During five years spent almost entirely in itinerating in the 'back-blocks'
of the colony, he has had exceptional opportunities for
studying bush-life. Finding, on his return to England, a widespread
interest in Australian affairs, coupled often with an astonishing
ignorance of the real Australia, it occurred to him to set down his
own experiences and views on various Australian problems. Knocking
about among the bushmen, camping with sleeper-cutters and
drovers, visiting the stations and selections 'out-back,' Mr. Matthews
has caught the spirit and atmosphere of the bush, with its mingled
pathos, humour and humanity. The book should appeal, not only
to those interested in missionary enterprise, but to all who like to
learn how the other parts of the Empire live.</p>

<span class="small"><span class="smcap">Editor of 'The Oxford Book of French Verse,' etc</span>.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Small 8vo., elegantly bound.</i> <b>5s. net.</b></p>

<p>The special claim of this anthology, arranged, as it is, by one of
our most promising younger poets, will be due to the prominence
given in it to the love-lyrics of those Elizabethan and Jacobean
poets whose verse, though really entitled to rank with the finest
flowers of their better-known contemporaries, is unduly neglected by
the ordinary reader. The love-lyric is, indeed, the only form in
which a great many of the lesser poets write anything at all
memorable.</p>

<p>Sidney and Campion, both writers of extraordinary power and
sweetness, devote themselves almost entirely to this form, and the
strange and passionate voice of Doune finds in it an accent of deep
and haunting eloquence. And since every love-lyric from Meleager
to Meredith has a certain deathless interest that is shared by every
poem of its kind, no matter how many the centuries between them,
in this volume the great line of the Elizabethans will lead to the
nineteenth century poets, to the singers of an epoch with a lyrical
harvest as great, indeed, as all the gold of Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="center">By REGINALD BLOMFIELD, A.R.A.,<br />

Author of</span> '<span class="smcap">A History of Renaissance Architecture in England</span>.'</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo.</i> <b>5s. net.</b></p>

<p>The author of this interesting book, who speaks, as it were,
<i>ex cathedr&acirc;</i>, has here collected a series of eight lectures on
architecture delivered in the Royal Academy. In them he has
endeavoured to establish a standpoint from which architecture should
be studied and practised. His general position is that architecture
is an art with a definite technique of its own, which cannot be translated
into terms either of ethics or of any of the other arts, and the
development of this thesis involves a somewhat searching criticism
of the views on architecture advanced by Ruskin and Morris.</p>

<p>The first four lectures deal with the study of architecture&mdash;its
relation to personal temperament, its appeal to the emotions, and
its limitations. In the last four, devoted to 'The Grand Manner,'
the writer has illustrated his conception of the aims and ideas of
architecture by reference to great examples of the art in the past.</p>

<p>This is an extremely interesting personal narrative of 'logging'

fringe the Pacific coast of Canada, and it is probably true that
no more strenuous work is done on the face of the earth. Mr.

<p class="center">A Dramatic Poem in Four Acts.</p>

<p class="center">By LEOPOLD H. MYERS.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo.</i> <b>4s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>The author of this play is a son of the late Frederick Myers, the
well-known authority on 'Psychical Research.' It is a poetical
drama in four acts, describing the rise and fall of the hero, Arvat.
The time and place are universal, as are also the characters. But
the latter, though universal, and therefore in a sense symbolic, are
psychologically human, and the significance of the action, heightened
as it may be by interpretation through the imagination, is nevertheless
independent of it. Thus Arvat's career, while providing subject-matter
for a drama among individuals in the flesh, may also be taken
as the symbol of a drama among ideas in the spirit.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Illustrated by Harry Rountree. Crown 8vo.</i> <b>3s. 6d.</b></p>

<p>The author of this charming tale ought to take rank with such
writers as Mrs. Molesworth in the category of childhood's literature.
The story tells of a little girl who visits her uncle in Germany and
spends a year in an old castle on the borders of a forest. There she
finds everything new and delightful. She makes friends with a dwarf
cobbler, who lives alone in a hut in the forest, and knows the speech
of animals and birds. Knut, the cobbler, is something of a hermit
and a misanthrope, but he is conquered by Peep-in-the-World, whom
he eventually admits to the League of Forest Friends. She wants
him to teach her how to talk to the wild things of the woods, and
though she has to leave Germany without learning the secret, she
gains a growing sense of the magic power of sympathy and kindness.</p>

queer boxing contests, and he has been present at the birth of the

and in the newspaper office that cuts and carves its speeches. And
he knows the story of the famous block in Piccadilly. He has found,
too, the problem of the London woman who is alone. The problem
also of those London children whom the Salvation Army rescues.

<p>Fiction is always the more interesting the more closely it is drawn
from life, and these sketches of naval and military society in Malta,
depicted in the form of stories, come from the pen of a lady who
is intimately acquainted with the life of which she writes. The
names of some of the stories, such as 'The Temptation of the
Engineer,' 'The Red Parasol,' 'The Prince, the Lady, and the
Naval Captain,' will perhaps be as good an indication as can be
given of the character of the book. It will doubtless appeal especially
to those familiar with society at naval and military stations, while the
fact of its having a specific <i>milieu</i>, should in no way detract from
its general interest. 'Plain Tales from the Hills' did not appeal
only to the Anglo-Indian.</p>

face with the Hooligan and the Burglar in their own haunts; but
through all the gloom and shadow of crime he has contrived to preserve
a fellow-feeling with humanity in its most depressing garb.
Every chapter is full of interest, of strange and quaint narratives in

<p>Some are vegetarians for conscience' sake, and others for the sake
of their health. Miss George caters for both these classes in her
new book; but she does not strictly exclude all animal food, since
eggs, butter, milk, cream and cheese form a large part of her dishes.
As far as possible, dietetic foods have been avoided in the recipes, as
they are often difficult to procure. Every recipe given has been
tested to ensure accuracy, and the simplest language is used in
explaining what has to be done. A special feature of the book is the
large number of vegetable souffl&eacute;s and creams. The various chapters
deal with Stock and Soups; Sauces; Pastes, Borders and Garnishes;
Casseroles, Patties, Pies, Puddings and Timbales; Curries, Stews
and Scallops; Galantines; Croquettes; Vegetables; Aspics, Creams

<p>This work, by a new author, is of a highly imaginative and romantic
tendency, and deals with a most interesting period in Scottish history.
The hero, who tells his own story, is an All Hallows child, born in
the one weird hour which makes him kith and kin to the spirits of
the air. The mystery of Flodden and the strange events grouped
round the ancient tradition as to the fate of the gallant James are
stirringly told, and lead up to the d&eacute;nouement, which comes with
vivid unexpectedness at the close of the book.</p>

<p>The lonely orphan of a wronged father is unwittingly schooled to
vengeance by the fiery Welsh swordsman Jevan, who, at the
instigation of the dying old nurse, forges the wizard steel that gives
the story its name.</p>

<p>A tender love idyll is woven into the tale and relieves the scenes
of violence through which the wearer of the Witch's Sword must

<p>Readers of 'Valerie Upton' will turn eagerly to Miss Sedgwick's
new novel. The scene is laid in England, and the principal characters
are four&mdash;Amabel Channice, her son, her husband, and
another woman, Lady Elliston. The relations between mother
and son form the basis of the story, and the dramatic situation
begins when the son, a youth of nineteen, broaches to his mother
the question why she and his father do not live together. Curiosity
is thus awakened, and the emotional atmosphere charged with uneasy
expectation. Thereafter events move quickly, reaching a dramatic
climax within the space of a week. Further than this it would not
be fair to the author to reveal her plot.</p>

<p>A novelist's third book, when its predecessors have shown great

establish his position. It is a comedy, having more affinity in style
with his first book, 'Where Angels Fear to Tread,' than with 'The
Longest Journey.' The author's whimsical humour, and unexpected
turns of satire, have attained a still more piquant quality. He excels
especially in satirizing the banalities of ordinary conversation, and
his dialogue is always deliciously amusing.</p>

the phenomena of life, their interdependence and causes, in language
intelligible to people of general education, and his book may be compared
in this respect with Dr. Hutchison's well-known work on

being too theoretical. The principle of Dr. Hutchison's new book
is to bring physiology from the laboratory to the bedside. 'Physiology,'
he writes, 'is studied in the laboratory, and clinical medicine
in the wards, and too often one finds that the student is incapable of
applying his scientific knowledge to his clinical work.'</p>

not stoop to the attempt to dazzle his public by phenomenal feats of

appealed to his southern audience, whilst the significance of his genius
dawned on the perception of one or two discerning musicians.)</p>

of the <i>Wiener Zeitung</i> writes that Herr Brahms was cordially
received by his "party.")</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_54">54</a>, "muscial" changed to "musical". (If, however, the audience of

artist, it must be said that his party consists of the cultivated
experts of musical Vienna.')</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_277">277</a>, "in is" changed to "is in". (The fourth prelude, 'Herzlich
